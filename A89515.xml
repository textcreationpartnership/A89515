            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I had a heart, O People of Rome, that knew as well to complaine as to conquer, it may bee the tenderneſs of my Teares would obtaine that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from you, which is denyed to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my Victories: See at your feet, O my Judges, an unfortunate man, to whom without boaſt, you are indebted for all your felicity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me ſuppliant, but without teares, they were all ſhed in Tuſcany upon the bodies of my two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not believing then, that he who had ſaved his Countrey, ſhould ever have need of weeping: O houſhold gods defended by me! you tutelary ones, whom I have preſerved, if I have deſerved any recompence, teach me onely what Divinity I ought to implore, to ſave my life, ſince you will not do it; O deceitfull hopes, unprofitable labours! O prodigy to be admired!
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115194:4"/>
                  <hi>Horace</hi> is ſuppliant, and not ſuppliant to any offended Deity, but to that Republique which holds from his Victory, that power which it now exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth upon him. O you gods who looked with a favorable eye upon the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour I underwent, to preſerve your Temples, and your Altars, ſuffer not that I make my vowes any more to you in vaine; let mee obtaine attention and pitty in thoſe hearts, which ſleep when they ſhould remember good turns, and who ſo ſlightly eſteeme their Wives, their Countrey, their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then lives, their Empire; nay, their gods themſelves, which I have preſerved to them, in expoſing my life to danger; I would not for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lives, O my Judges, that you ſhould believe me ſo affrighted at death, that it were abſolutely neceſſary for mee to beg life at your hands. Fathers conſcript, I am a Roman born of that Houſe, in which the Republique hath found three men, whom it judged worthy to defend it. I have a ſoul reſolute enough to meet a greater danger than that I am in, and if the fact which I have committed (which ought to be ſtiled a zeale for my Countrey) might not alſo bee named a fratricide, I ſhould ſlight that death, which I deſired in the field, when my dear Brothers fell; I have a heart which loves life, when it may doe ſervice to my Countrey, and which would not flie death, when it is neceſſary to confirm the generoſity of life: when is it that death could be leſs frightfull, or more willingly imbraced than now, when I have given life to the people of Rome? Death cannot come too ſwift to him who hath attained to honour and glory, neither can it be ill for a good man: I do not refuſe to offer my head to the block, yet I confeſs I have ſome repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, to ſee my ſelfe ready to be deprived of life by the ingratefull ſword of the Romans, and be confident, I have more griefe to finde my high ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices at ſo low an eſteem, that I ſhould need to ask life, then I ſhall have to loſe it: I returne triumphant, O my Judges, from a field, where (by this ſword) I have interred the fortune of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and from a field which I have beſprinkled with my owne, and my Brothers bloud, and from a field conſecrated to the victory of the Romans, all our Countrey, and all our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was nothing but Palmes and Lawrels, the Earth, the Army, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the gods applauded our Triumph, when a Woman preſented her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before me, afflicted at my Victory, ſad at the greatneſs of the Empire, upbraiding and curſing the valour of my Arme and your Fortune, invoking the vengeance of the Heavens, and the gods, wiſhing a generall deſolation of our Countrey, ſtriving to draw upon us, by her imprecations, the ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſtars, and the fury of Hell: My ſword, accuſtomed to ſhed the bloud of them, who look'd with griefe upon the happineſſe of my deare Countrey was, in this, but the juſt revenger of ſo baſe and black a crime:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115194:4"/>I ſheath'd my Ponyard in the heart of her, who could know how to grieve at the advantages of her Countrey; I believed I had made a juſt ſacrifice of that infamous one, who when ſhee died wept at the victory of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
               <p>This is the Fact, for which thoſe that envy my happy ſucceſſe, have made me guilty, that they might utterly deface that little vertue which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not equall: they reſolve I ſhall ſuffer becauſe I have deſtroyed a fierce Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſuch a one, that even among the Tuſcane Troups, there is not to bee found a perſon who bewailed their misfortunes with ſo great a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But if to deſtroy the Enemies of our Countrey, be a crime meriting death, why did I not ſuffer it in that day wherin I returned Conqueror of the three brave <hi>Curiacii?</hi> what? ſhould that unfortunate Wretch have been exempted from the puniſhment ſhee deſerved, becauſe ſhee was born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe Walls, which ſhe wiſht to ſee buried in their own Ruines? It was that which was not reaſonable, and that which I could not ſuffer; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, it was a ſpectacle too ſad, for the eyes of a Roman to ſee any one weep in the midſt of the victories of their Countrey; why did you (O Romans) lay all the care of the Common-wealth upon my ſhoulders, when it was tottering and ready to fall; if you believed me ſo feeble that I could endure to ſee any body ſhed tears, as condemning my actions? I put all my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this, that thoſe who are to bee the Judges of my Cauſe, are the ſame perſons for whoſe ſake I committed the crime, and that thoſe who pronounce my death ſhall be forced to confeſſe, that it is from me alone they hold their liberties, their lives, their Authority, their Victory, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique; and that from the fact for which you pretend I ought to make excuſes, I ſay, I ought to reap advantages: I was ſo zealous for the honour of my Countrey, that I did not forbeare to revenge it on my owne ſiſter, when ſhee wept and declared her ſelfe an enemy: Thoſe which love their Countrey leſs then I, might perhaps have pardoned its greateſt enemies; but I could not forgive my owne ſiſter, becauſe I loved my Countrey more then my ſiſter, more then my Father, yea, more then my ſelfe: I believed I ſhould have had more need to have implored your mercy for ſparing, rather than for killing a ſiſter that had ſo loſt her piety; but what ſaid I? a ſiſter? no, ſhe is no ſiſter of <hi>Horaces</hi> who bewailes the death of the <hi>Curiaces,</hi> and who with griefe beholds the Victory of her Countrey, and their Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; what? will it be poſſible to finde out a heart that beares ſo little affection to the Common-wealth, and ſo little gratitude to me, that it will not know that deſigne in killing that deteſtable perſon, was to extinguiſh a dangerous Crime, and not the life of a ſiſter? neither was ſhe a ſiſter when
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115194:4"/>ſhe was an enemy of my Countrey, nor was I her brother when I thruſt my ponyard into her heart, I was the Arme of Victorious Rome, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Enemy of the Republique, and its ſupporters: Let my Accuſers ſhew you by what degrees of wickedneſſe I have proceeded; can it be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that theſe hands yet never ſtained with bloud, but in a juſt cauſe, ſhould of the ſudden arrive to the higheſt pitch of impiety and fratricide? let them upbraid me with crime, if ever this Sword hath given death to any, but to ſave the life of my Countrey; I render thanks to Fortune, O Rome (deare to my heart) that ſhee hath given me ſo notable a way to ſhew the love I beare and owe thee, in the field I have fought againſt thine Enemies, and in the City againſt them of Nature, and I was no more conquered by the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I had for my ſiſter, then by the valour of the Tuſcans: Well then it is thought juſt that ſo great a favour as I have received from Fortune, ſhould coſt me no leſſe then my life, nor would I refuſe to give it upon this occaſion, if I had not reſolv'd to loſe it, O Rome, to adde to thy glory; what then ſhal I bee in a more dangerous condition that am victorious, then my Brothers (which were not? they found the end of their miſeries in their deſtruction, and I the beginning of my calamity in my Victory: Ought this to be the cauſe of my teares? or to ſay better fatall to me the love of the Common-wealth? the memory of my vertue? the glorious remembrance of my Victory, and triumph? I confeſs I pitty that part of my bloud which I ſpilt in deſtroying that unfortunate Woman; yet after all, I cannot think it ſpilt, ſeeing it was ſacrificed to the victory of the Common-wealth; and truly I had deſerved ſhe ſhould have wept for my atchievements, if I had not had generoſity enough to conquer the tenderneſs of Nature, and that my heart had wanted reſolution to take her life, that would elſe have drowned her ſelfe in envious teares, for the liberty purchaſed by my bloud, of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; by this action alone, our enemies from henceforward, can have no hope to reap any fruit of all their practiſes, when they ſhall ſee that it is permitted to ſacrifice our owne ſiſters that looke malignly upon the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of our ſwords; but my fault (juſtifiable if committed upon another) ſeemes only monſtrous, becauſe ſhe was a perſon ſo neare me in bloud, as if when we were to puniſh the malignants of our Countrey, we ought to take counſel of the inclinations of Nature: Conſider with a fatherly eye, O Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, if it were not impoſſible for me to know that guilty one; for how could I take notice of her, as of a ſiſter, hearing her complain for the victory of her Brother? or how could I remember her to be a Roman, when ſhee ſpoke the ſence of the Tuſcans? I believed her to be a relique of the <hi>Curia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii,</hi> and I thought I ſhould doe an Act of piety to my Countrey, in rending
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115194:5"/>up by the root, a Tree that might bring fruit to ſupport our enemies power and if this action bee of a ſtraine ſo black and ſhamefull, that it cannot bee expiated but upon a Scaffold, with the bloud of this unfortunate man, who hath added one Naile to the Wheele of the Roman Fortune, then you think the death of her that bewayled your Victory, more incompatible with your government, then the life of him that gave it you: Perhaps it diſpleaſes you, that I ſhould take away from the Tuſcans her that might have increaſed the Curiaces; but believe me, if I had ſuffered a Woman, of the Houſe of the <hi>Horacii,</hi> to have been long fruitful in Tuſcany, it may be the Romans could not have kept their Empire, nor would the Tuſcans (at leaſt quietly) have permitted them. What? was the life of this Traytreſs ſo precious, that there muſt be ſacrific'd to it, that life which was the ſoule of the greatneſs, and Fortune of the Latines? But what voice, or what rumour is that I hear, which interupting my diſcourſe, hinders me from further declaring my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence? Who are they that deny me the favour of pleading for that life, which hath preſerved the life and liberty of the Common-wealth? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a deadly ſpectacle, and worthy of tears; ſee, O my Judges, ſee my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who never fail'd of his duty to the Republique, but when he begat this Daughter; ſee, O ſee an unfortunate Father, who hath newly loſt two ſonnes, to aſſure to you thoſe powerfull ſeats you now poſſeſs, look how he fears to be depriv'd of the third and laſt, who ſurely (if there be any gods) ſhall not die without vengeance; hear how he complains, that he, a Roman, and chiefe of the <hi>Horatii</hi> ſhould be thought ſo baſe, that with his owne hands he would not have torne out my very bowels, if he did not know that his Daughter was juſtly ſhine; O Heavens! ſhall I bee ſo unfortunate to die, for taking out of the world a Woman who was thought unworthy to continue in it by her owne Father? Can you ſuppoſe that thoſe Troops which I have returned to you victorious, will ever endure to ſee him drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to death that gave them life, and victory? What! ſhall Romes Enemies ſee him puniſhed, that the Common-wealth thought only worthy to defend its honour? Could the Tuſcans deſire more miſchiefe to him that rendred them miſerable? I am not ſo little acquainted with humane frailty, that I repine at my mortality, at my death, but I grieve for not being thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and to ſee that my Countrey will be guilty; things are reduc'd to ſuch terms, that as long as the Common-wealth remaines, it will bee ſtain'd with ingratitude; I am forc'd to deteſt my owne honour, O ſtrange eſtate that you have plac'd me in! ſince it is juſt to wiſh, that my death had gone before my victory, and the eſtabliſhment of your Empire. What! ſhall my fortune bee worſe in the Capitol then in <hi>Hetruria?</hi> Can that be, O Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115194:6"/>I ſweare by the ſouls of my two Brothers, who were ſo voluntarily ſacrific'd to your Greatneſs, that I have more ſhame of the Roman people, than grief for being ſo cruelly depriv'd of my life and triumph, which I have ſo well deſerv'd; but ſo long as I carry with mee to my Tombe the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spoiles of the <hi>Curiacii,</hi> the Scaffold will be as honourable to me as the Capitol; I deſire nothing of you, O my Judges, but that you will be always your ſelves, and that before you pronounce the ſentence of my death, you will be pleaſed to remember, that while I was arming my ſelfe to the fight, you offer'd up Prayers and Vows to the gods for my life; ſtay! O ſtay you thunders, O you Powers that hearken to us, and tell how many times the people cried me up to be the Preſerver and Father of my Countrey; and if it bee true that I was ſo, will you puniſh Fratricide with Paricide, and in ſtead of imploying your gratefulneſs in adorning me with a <hi>Statua,</hi> will you take away my life in an ignominious manner?

Comfort him, O Senators, and tell him, that it is true I die honourably, tell him that the Gallowes (if ever upbraided in the Houſe of the <hi>Horacii</hi>) is not ſhamefull; tell him that I did not mount the Scaffold, but in deſcending from the Charriot of Triumph; make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that if there be Fathers that have had Children more happy, there is none that hath had a Son more generous; aſſure him, that you will alwaies remember the bloud of his Sons, loſt for the Common-wealth; ſweare to him, that you will not forget, that I have ſhed my bloud for your ſafeties; tell him, that you confeſſe, that it is from me you hold your plenty, and all

But what ſhall I ſay (O Senators) theſe are but effeminate fancies? ſhal then future ages know, that in a Roman heart any tenderneſs was ſufficient to make Fratricide ſupportable? ſhall there bee found any hearts ſo much at enmity with their Countrey, as not to fear the evils which ſuch a preſident may bring forth, if this ſhould paſſe unpuniſhed? and what fortifications can ſecure us from the violence of his ſword that hath been once victorious, if this wickedneſs ſhall eſcape like the ſword of juſtice? ought I to feare the fury of a people obliged by the fury of this guilty perſon, as if I made ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account of the wiſdome and juſtice of the Romans, that I did not thinke them capable of judging betwixt good and evil, and to puniſh crimes with rigour, as well as recompence generous actions with Bayes and glory? 'tis fit for the honour of the Senate to make it appear to ſuch as merit Triumphs, that they ought not to be ſo confident in the peoples favour (which is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as the winde) as from thence to aſſume ſo much boldneſs and inſolence as to thinke by their ſwords to ſtay the courſe of juſtice: well, well!

               <p>This Murtherer thinks perhaps to excuſe himſelfe by ſaying, he kill'd his ſiſter for grieving at the Victories of her Countrey; why he kill'd her wee know not, but we are ſure ſhe is dead; what! did the Roman Tribunall want a ſword of juſtice to cut off a corrupted member from the body of the Common-wealth? who gave thee commiſſion to imploy thine upon this occaſion? who knowes but that he kill'd his ſiſter leſt ſhe ſhould diſcover ſome cauſe for her tears in fit to be knowne? but put caſe ſhe did grieve at the proſperity of the Common-wealth; thence conſider what ſtock this man is ſprung from whoſe ſiſters lament for the proſperities of their owne native Countrey: nay, the unfortunate Wretch wept not for the loſſe of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand nor was troubled at the triumphs of the Common-wealth, but was aſham'd at this mans glories: ſhe was not ſorry ſhe had loſt a Tuſcane Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but griev'd ſhe had a Brother that fought like an Arabian, not a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

               <p>I do not denie, but that Nature hath created man with an inclination to love and preſerve the body, but it is an inclination which the Beaſts have <hi>in commune</hi> with us, and which it may be Nature doth not give, but to keep us from deteſting that life, which experience ſhewes us to bee the object of all miſeries imaginable: The Earth is a naturall, but a painfull abode, it is a reſidence which the wiſe ought not to ſlight, ſo long as they may exerciſe the beſt affects of their Reaſon, but when Fortune and Reaſon have reduc'd them to ſuch terms, that they cannot make uſe of Vertue without being ſcorned by the wicked, what life is it then? it would be an Argument of a meane ſoule, if I ſhould feare either danger or change in my vertue: ſo long as there was hope to conquer my misfortunes by conſtancy, I preſerved my life (expecting better times for the Common wealth and for my ſelfe,) but who now ſeeth not that the publique affairs are deſperate, and that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is overthrowne, and that I cannot aid my Countrie any other way, but in ſending <hi>Cato</hi> to Heaven? it is my griefe that thou haſt not yet ſerved thy Countrie ſo much as thou oughteſt, who art borne my ſonne, for if thou hadſt, I would perſwade thee alſo to ſtop by thy death the inſtability of Fortune, and to prevent an unhappy life, by which thou mayeſt know, if thou conſidereſt rightly, whether he ought to be deplored that is delivered

               <p>I was made ſo independing both by Heaven and Nature, that I ſhould bluſh to bee found alive in <hi>Caeſars</hi> time, as well as under his Empire: if it troubles thee that thy Countrey ſhall loſe <hi>Cato,</hi> let him ſurvive in thy actions; as often as thou ſhalt recount my life in thy memory, thou ſhalt have me living in my Examples, and my Precepts; all love is vicious which is not grounded upon Reaſon; if thou loveſt mee, imitate my Vertue, for when thou ſhalt love mee by immitation, thou wilt ſee that the Common-wealth hath not loſt <hi>Cato,</hi> who ſhall certainly ſee him, both living, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the vertue of his Son.</p>

               <p>AT the laſt I have ſeene that which I thought had never beene poſſible. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> obliged by a Mortall; here it is (O <hi>Caeſar</hi>) that thou firſt triumph'ſt over Aegypt; when thou haſt conquered the Kingdome by thy Fortune, that Fortune hath brought thee to viſit <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> not to comfort her in her great diſaſters, but to teach the world they ought to ſubmit, as well to thy Vertue, as to avoid thy ſword: what object can thine eies deſire to ſee more pleaſing? or what Muſick can ſound more ſweet in thine eares, then to heare <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſpeake humbly? and that the Queene of Aegypt ſhould have need to offer Vowes and Prayers? O <hi>Caeſar,</hi> thy Vertue hath rais'd thee to ſo ſupreame a pitch of greatneſs, that thy meere viſits have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make Queens happy; this is the firſt time ſince my reign, that favors are done mee upon Earth, I never received any that I eſteemed ſo, but from Heaven alone, from Heaven ſaid I? alas, it's benigne influences are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into maligne, and inauſpitious; it hath left mee no hope, unleſs it be that my Conqueror hath as well the generoſity, as the high courage of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>I have had heretofore ſo large experience, and intereſt in the gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Romans, your Peers, that I ſhould deem my ſelfe ungratefull, if I had not an entire aſſurance in the Vertue of a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> there doth now ariſe a large ſubject for hope to this captive Queene, ſeeing that the mercy of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror invites him thus early to do her this honour: and I confeſs my ſelfe to be more overcome, by the gentleneſs of this Viſit, then I was by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of thy Troops: Force and violence overcame there, heere nothing but thy Vertue ſubdues.</p>
               <p>I give thee thankes (O moſt noble Conquerour) and if I doe it not as I ought, it is but an effect of my diſaſtrous fortune, the memory of my paſt felicities diſorders me in this new learning of giving thanks: how tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the favour of Fortune is, <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> condition furniſheth a great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

               <p>Unfortunate <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to what extremity art thou reduc'd? if I would oblige thee (O <hi>Caeſar</hi>) it is neceſſary that I praiſe thee, and if I praiſe thee worthily, I can finde no nobler way, then by recounting the glory of that great <hi>Anthony</hi> whom Fortune made chiefe of all men, to ſhew to thee, that the chiefe of all men was leſs then thy Vertue, leſs then thy valour, and leſs then thy Fortune.</p>
               <p>I am indebted to the Deſtinies (alwaies mine Enemies) for no other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but that my infelicitie hath miniſtred matter to oblige thy generoſity, to exerciſe thy high Vertue: There runs for all that a confuſed rumour, that thou intendeſt to carry me hence Captive, and to make me follow thy Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot in thy triumph; but be pleaſed to believe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> is not capable of ſuffering ſuch contempt; death cannot ſeem to come too haſtily to her who hath already ſeen the death of her Reigne, and Liberty.</p>
               <p>I am forc'd (being terrified by ſo unpleaſing a noiſe) to ſupplicate thee (O mercifull Conqueror) not to thinke of a thing ſo contrary to my quality, and I am the rather a Suitor unto thee, becauſe thou ſhoul'd doe things ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the favour of this Viſit, then for any need I have to obtaine that of thee which I can alwaies command from my ſelfe; I ſweare to thee, I had already conducted my intereſts to an aſſured Port, by this hand, if I were not obliged to acknowledge thy civilities, for I will not that thou reproach me, as thy Divine Father did <hi>Cato,</hi> that I envied thee the glory of pardoning mee.</p>
               <p>Be content with this, that I am become a Suppliant; it is no ſmall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to ſee <hi>Cleopatra</hi> petitioning, and humble: I aſſure thee that a heart leſſe then thine ſhould never be intreated by <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for that ſoule accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to receive reſpects from the <hi>Caeſars</hi> themſelves, would diſdaine to humble it ſelfe before man; If I did not know thy Vertue worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame honours which we render to the gods.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt know the value of this triumph which ought to make thee proud? demand of Heaven, if ever <hi>Cleopatra</hi> offered vowes to any but to the gods, and <hi>Caeſar;</hi> I know thou remembreſt the Time, the Affection, the Treaſures, and the Men, I have imployed in the ſervice of <hi>Anthony:</hi> But I alſo know (O noble Enemy) that thou art not ignorant of the price of that faith which ought to be inviolable, from the inſtant in which it is given.</p>
               <p>Alas, unfortunate <hi>Cleopatra!</hi> of what crime art thou detected, if not for being faithfull? if I had betrayed my Party, as others have done, I ſhould bee ſtill the ſo much adored, <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> but becauſe my faith was unſhaken, ought I to be drawn as a vile ſlave after thy triumphant Chariot,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115194:20"/>by that which I have done for <hi>Anthony?</hi> conſider (O <hi>Caeſar</hi>) what I may doe for thee, if thou ſhalt be favourable unto mee: Could I bee ſo baſe to breake my faith with the conquered, and imbrace his fortune that is victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I ſhould bee ſecured from the perill which now threateneth me; but thou canſt have no aſſurance (O <hi>Caeſar</hi>) that I will not betray thee, as well as another, if the reliques of the Triumvirate ſhould produce any new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of war.</p>
               <p>I have ſerv'd (I confeſs) and lov'd as much as I ought the noble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Anthony,</hi> and I dare ſweare (ſo certaine am I) that <hi>Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would have ſerv'd him, if he had beene in <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> place, ſince the effects of Vertue never change, although their reſidence be in ſeverall hearts! alas unfortunate <hi>Anthony!</hi> that the memory of a Name ſo ſweet, ſhould be this day ſo bitter to me; pardon me <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if thou art as mercifull as victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? pardon me, I ſay, if my indiſcreet tenderneſſe makes me lament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy face, the death of thine Enemy: I ſigh for mine owne misfortunes, not for the eſtabliſhment of thy unparrallel'd greatneſs; that thought is too ſenſible, when I call to minde a man who never did any thing without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for his object my will.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing alone, that gives me cauſe to complaine of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> which is, that I have heard him ſweare a thouſand times, (which I now deem flattery) that my beauty was divine, and all powerfull, and that it might ſoften Rocks; thou deceivedſt me <hi>Anthony,</hi> and thou deceivedſt thy ſelfe, ſeeing it cannot cauſe one ſentiment of pity in his heart, whoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie is greater then his fortune, although his fortune bee greater then his Empire of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine, O Caeſar,</hi> the ſum of my petition is, that I may increaſe thy repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in being content to obtaine of thy vertue, that which I can alwaies obtaine of my owne; I intreat thee to conſent that I may live without ſhame, for otherwiſe in teaching <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that thou intendeſt to triumph over her, is but to teach <hi>Cleopatra</hi> that it is time for her to triumph over her ſelfe; for ſhe is abſolutely reſolved to follow no other Chariot, then that of thy mercy; if thou intendſt by thy Victory to draw that baſe humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation from my misfortunes, thou mayſt well ſee <hi>Cleopatra</hi> amongſt thy Triumphs of death, but never amongſt the Triumphs of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> in being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to hinder my death, to the end, to preſerve mee to encreaſe the number of the Trophies and Spoiles which thou deſtineſt to the Capitoll, is not out of a deſire I ſhould live, but that I ſhould ſurvive my reputation; which is not magnanimous, which is not like <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115194:21"/>
               <p>If the malignity of any fatall ſtarre had rendred thee to the condition that I am in, wouldſt thou ſubmiſſively reſolve to follow a Chariot? No! no, life is not precious enough to be purchaſed ſo dearly; and what honour can it be to him to triumph over a Queen, endued with no more generoſity then to be capable of living to be carried in triumph?</p>
               <p>Remember (noble Enemy) that the moſt feeble and vulgar power may deprive me of life, and uſe me ill, but the conſervation of my firſt Majeſty is an action of an Arme no leſs powerfull then Princely: <hi>Caeſar</hi> I aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for telling thee that the inclination to take revenge is as much below <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> is above the power of being offended; chaſtiſements that proceed from ſuch as you, if they have not for their end, the deſigne of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Offendor an Example, are fury, and not correction.</p>
               <p>My miſeries as they now appeare, may ſerve for inſtruction of all thoſe that hereafter, like <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> would ingage their affections for an <hi>Anthony;</hi> thou haſt attained to ſuch a degree of greatneſſe, that for expiation of crimes committed againſt thee, that ought to ſuffice which appeaſeth the gods, which is to ſay, I confeſſe I have done amiſs and ask pardon.</p>
               <p>To conclude, even the common Animals, at leaſt thoſe that are generous, alwaies treat them favourably whom they finde humble; if to exalt thy Victory it were neceſſary that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſhould follow thy Chariot, I would enchaine my ſelfe to increaſe thy glory; a thouſand conſolations, drawne from paſt examples, attend my misfortunes, as that to bee conquered by a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> though it be a misfortune, it is one of thoſe which are honourable; that I have not wanted the courage of a Conqueror, though I have wanted the fortune; that Queenes are not leſs mortall then Kings, and that all things in the world have an end. It is thus that I comfort my ſelfe, and thus that I reſolve to honour the Triumph of my Conqueror, if the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of my Conqueror may bee honoured by my miſeries; but to appeare Conquerour of Aegypt, it is more proper for thee to carry the Crowne, then the head of <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> neither ſhalt thou ever ſee <hi>Cleopatra</hi> humble her ſelfe to ſuffer ſuch an indignity, for if ſhe hath not ſtrength to revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done her, ſhe ſhal have at leaſt ſtrength enough to deliver her ſelfrom the violence of thoſe that offend her; thus thou mayeſt ſee, O <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that there is not any thing to be gained of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> by any other way, then by generoſity.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt appeare incomparably more great, by thy mercy, and by thy mercy exerciſed towards an Enemy that repents, then for having beene the cauſe of the death of a miſerable Queene, for the ſhort and vaine pleaſure
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115194:21"/>of this Ambition; but if the hate which thou haſt for <hi>Anthony,</hi> incline thee to be cruell to me, to the end that thou leaveſt not unpuniſhed any one thing relating to <hi>Anthony,</hi> to what purpoſe is all this? Alas <hi>Caeſar!</hi> conſider how ill it becomes a man of honour to be cruell to the dead, the Victory of the generous ought to be bloudy rather in, then after the Battell: but if for the compleatment of thy Victory, thou wouldſt finiſh the Conqueſt of <hi>Anthony,</hi> let the world then ſee, that thy Victories proceed from thy Vertue alone, and not at all from thy fortune, and what greater puniſhment can bee affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon a noble ſoule, then to make it ſenſible what a generous, what a mercifull, and what a noble Conqueror it hath tranſgreſs'd againſt?</p>
               <p>But ſince Fortune hath beene ſo cruell to deprive us of the body of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> ſave his Soul, O mercifull Enemy, for even that was <hi>Cleopatra's:</hi> but alas! what ſay I in my griefe? what? could the ſoule of <hi>Anthony</hi> ſurvive <hi>Anthony,</hi> and humble it ſelfe before <hi>Caeſar?</hi> Ah poore <hi>Anthony!</hi> thou wouldſt never have permitted <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to have entreated ſo long in vaine, but if the rigour of my deſtiny will render mee ſo concern'd in the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of another, as that the love of <hi>Anthony</hi> ſhould endanger mee, why may I not as well hope for advantage from the reſpective affection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Caeſar</hi> heretofore honoured me? that <hi>Caeſar</hi> which thou reckoneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thy Fathers, is reckoned amongſt my Husbands; if thou doſt drag me after thy Charriot of Triumph, wilt thou not bluſh to thinke thou doſt not triumph without paricide? <hi>Caeſar!</hi> the reputation of thy clemency is ſo great, that in denying thy mercy to me alone, thou wilt declare upon the Theatre of the world, mee to bee the moſt unworthy to receive it that ever was, which is to doe injury to the judgement of thy divine Father, who much loved me; cruell Fortune! to what haſt thou reduc'd mee? the war is finiſhed, yet I have not finiſhed my loſſes; poore <hi>Cleopatra!</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are turn'd braſſe to thee, aſwell as the heart of him that holds thee cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if I doe not bewaile my misfortunes as I ought, it is not an effect of my pride, it is of my deſpaire; Tears cannot enough expreſs my miſeries for thoſe which give us leave to complaine, are common, neither doe I thinke it civill to ſhed Teares before <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe vertue would bee offended, if I believed it capable of a feeble and baſe pity, for pity is a vertue of a low and vulgar ſoule: I call upon <hi>Caeſar</hi> to make uſe of his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, not his compaſſion.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, it would bee a great addition to my misfortunes, if I found in my Conqueror a popular courage; but it is time that I hold my peace, not that I want words, for the Deſtinies have left mee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>I inſiſt upon this to ſhew thee, how happy hee is whoſe felicity is ſuch, that his very Triumphs themſelves afford new matter of Triumph, but I will not be indebted to the force of my Reaſons, becauſe I doe not deſire to have them eſteemed powerfull and great, but to have found thee ſo; for my part I have no doubt of thy vertue, but I miſtruſt my owne Fortune, and I feare the Heavens (enemies to my peace) ſhould take from thee ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an occaſion to gaine honour, and raviſh from me the opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to thy magnificence.</p>
               <p>Conſider (O <hi>Caeſar</hi>) to what height of power thou art aſcended; as to my intereſt thou art above the ſtars, upon thy will depends my Fate, and whatſoever thou wilt, ſhall be my condition, and if thou in thy mercy grant me that which is fit for me to aske, and that which I ought to obtaine, thou ſhalt be deified by thy Valour, and adored by the ſubjected <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> thou ſhalt be the Diſpoſer of liberty, the Conſerver of life, the Maſter of Deſtiny, and the Protector of Kings, properties not inferiour to the gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But if the implacable anger of Heaven, together with the unalterable decree of Fortune be ſuch, that it hath deafned thee to my requeſts, that I cannot hope to finde <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> behold this boſome (O great Conqueror) oppreſt with all calamities, for its laſt refuge to reſt, eagerly implores to receive from thy famous ſword, as an effect of pity, that death which otherwiſe I ſhall ſearch by the moſt horrid wayes that can force a ſoule from a body; if it be forbid thee by any higher power to oblige mee by thy mercy, it is not forbid thee to favour me by thy ſword; my adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhal be glorious, if I fall under that ſword which hath conquerd all the Eaſt, and which in delivering me from the infamy of ſervitude, ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to die free, and a Queene to whom the apprehenſion onely of the Capitol, and the conſideration of attending a Charriot render this life inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>VVHat god (favourable to the Trojans, our Enemies) hath ſowed in our Camp this furious ſedition? hearken to mee, O Souldiers! if your military obedience doe yet render you ſuch; I would call you Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, if the quality of a King might ſuffer an equall: what tumult is this? what! I that within theſe few dayes was proclaimed King of Kings, not to have power to preſerve mine owne bloud? Alas! I am aſhamed to ſpeake of the madneſs of my Army, I refuſe not the head of my <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> to be offered for the publique ſafety, but I refuſe it to particular Envy, if you judge it a thing requiſite for the honour of our Troops, not onely to ſprinkle the Altars, but to drowne our fields with the bloud of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; it ſhall bee I my ſelfe who will conduct the Victime to the Altar, and will rejoyce more to have bred them for the good of my Countrey, then for the repoſe of my Age; for what bloud can be more happily pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth, then that which ſerves to appeaſe the angry gods, and render
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115194:23"/>happineſs to our Countrey? Certainly, if ye believe I had a ſoule capable of meaner thoughts then theſe, it would be an injury both to your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and honours in making choice of mee to command ſo many brave men, otherwiſe the moſt vile Members of this great Body might have been made the chiefe: No, no! whilſt <hi>Agamemnon</hi> lives, the head of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> ſhall not want a Sacrificer; but it ſeems very reaſonable to me, that Pity in theſe generous Troopes, who to recover an Adultereſſe, ſlight their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, their Kindred, their Goods, their Wives and Children, and all things dear to them, either in this world or in that to come; it ſeems (I ſay) very reaſonable, that they conſider firſt, if the ſtayning their hands in the bloud of a Virgin, be an Act proper to render the gods propitious to our deſignes; for how can a ſacrifice offer'd with ſo much praecipitation pleaſe the gods? believe, O valiant People! O believe that when you offer a ſacrifice in fury, you ſatisfie no god but that of Envy alone; it is a thing which to mee ſeems very ſtrange, that for regaining of an Adultreſſe, it ſhould be thought fit to loſe a Virgin, and that to recover the daughter of another, it ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought convenient, but neceſſary, that I this day loſe mine owne; if innocency ſhall be expoſed to loſſe, you will force your Daughters to that adultery, which findes more ſafety and protection then Virginity it ſelfe; if we may begin our enterpriſe no other way, but by the death of my poor Daughter, who will not confeſs that this war is ominous to mee, before there is any violation of peace to begin the hopes of our Victories with the bloud of our Daughters; alas! it is to begin them with our owne loſſes, if we are out of hope, that the gods will not be favourable to our deſignes, unleſs we imbraw the Earth and Sea in the bloud of our own bowels; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will be a very criminous attonement.</p>
               <p>Thoſe atchievements are too deare bought, that coſt us a Victime, for the preſervation whereof, no Victime ſhould be thought too precious: I have ſeen a war begun for the defence of Virgins, but never ſaw the murther of a Maid inaugurate the happy ſucceſſe of a war; that may be called loſing of the battell without fighting, and to fill our houſes with murther before they be taken, and without looking one Trojan in the face, wee ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the death of our Children: God forbid, that our undertakings ſhould be ſo inauſpitious; reſerve! reſerve the fury of your ſwords to deſtroy the Daughters of your Enemies.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Ilion</hi> ſhall not bee more ſwift to ſhut their Ports for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, then we will bee to flie to the immolation of the moſt illuſtrious Virgins of <hi>Troy,</hi> there we will aſſwage our angers, and revenge our indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities without ſparing a Maid that breaths in the aire of our Enemies, from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115194:24"/>the rigour of our ſwords: But what new aſtoniſhment is that I read in your faces? you ſeeme to have in horror the thoughts onely of a ſpectacle ſo bloudy, I was confident in repreſenting to you the maſſacre of yong Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, I had choſen an entertainment agreeable to your inclinations: Poore <hi>Iphigenia!</hi> under what malignant ſtar wert thou borne, that, that rigour which would be cruell, barbarous, and deteſtable, if it were afflicted upon the Daughters of our Enemies, is believed honeſt, pious, and deſirable, when it is addreſs'd to our owne? what? ſhall the ſiſters of <hi>Paris</hi> then feare the Graecians leſſe then the Daughters of <hi>Agamemnon?</hi> who taught us that Religion which makes us mercifull to others, and cruell to our ſelves?</p>
               <p>To begin the war by an act ſo inhumane is to better the condition of our Enemies, becauſe we oblige the Heavens to defend thoſe that are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, for who can deny that a Raviſher ſins leſs then a Homicide, and that it is a leſſe fault to have loved a Wanton, then to murther a Virgin? <hi>Paris</hi> oppoſed, and wreſtled with his luſts, as appear'd by the feares of his flight, and thoſe of his conſcience, to ſhew to the world, that at leaſt hee knew his guilt, and dreaded puniſhment as well from the gods, as men; but how ſhall we excuſe our crime, the wickedneſs of which renders us impious and cruell towards both gods and men?</p>
               <p>We ſtile the prophanation of the Altars an Act of Piety, and as a ſacrifice celebrate a deteſtable murther, who can excuſe thoſe crimes committed, not onely before the eies, but even upon the very Altars of the gods? I am not ignorant that the wickedneſſe of thoſe who propoſed this ſacrifice, will ſay that the divine Decrees ought to be obayed, and not diſputed; but I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the Athenians, to appeare falſely devout, were not aſhamed to picture their gods cruell Homicides, thoſe very ſacred Intelligences which dwell above, for the preſervation of Mortals, doe revenge, not deſire the death of Innocents.</p>
               <p>What? have the Gods rendred the Heavens ſerene, and the Sea calme, to favour the flight of an incontinent, and after doe they ſhew them in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſtormes, thirſting for the blood of a Virgin, who perchance is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Hecatombs for them, whiles they are decreeing her ruine? No, no! it would be a Hell upon Earth, if the Heavens ſhould oblige us to ſhed the precious bloud of Innocents; how is it poſſible that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to reigne over a world deſert and wicked? and who is there abject enough to continue amongſt thoſe Deities, whoſe number is not compoſed, but of more vile then our ſelves? but what god is it hath brought cruelty into Heaven, as if humane kinde were to be made the object of fury inſtead
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115194:24"/>of love and mercy? all ſacred forbid, O <hi>Jupiter!</hi> that wee ſhould believe the gods to be more cruell to us then our enemies themſelves; what? the Trojans love our Daughters, and the gods maſſacre them? it is not likely; produce the Prieſts, and name the Temples where this Oracle hath beene heard and receiv'd, that we may not raſhly precipitate any thing againſt the innocent, which hath alwaies been known by all to be the prime object of love to the infinite powers; let us bee carefull that that piety which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to remove the clouds from the neck of <hi>Juno,</hi> take not away by violence the thunder bolts from the hand of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you tell me, that <hi>Calcas</hi> the Interpreter of the gods (to deliver our Fleet, which the Sea holds as beſieged, and which, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, conſpireth for the defence of our Enemies) hath pronounced this, which is rather to be called a ſacriledge, then a ſacrifice to appeaſe the gods of the woods incenſed by my hand for the death of a Hinde? I anſwer, that certainly any other but <hi>Calcas</hi> a Magician, a Sorcerer and Conjurer, accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all his life time to the formidable way of Hell, by incantation with certaine verſes which hee muttereth more horrid then his owne conſcience, would never endeavour to acquire the reputation of Interpreter to the gods, by ſuch a deteſtable invention, as to ingage us to the neceſſity of ſhedding innocent bloud.</p>
               <p>But it is time, that I diſcover to you the tumour of this wound, that you may know how poyſonous the ſteele is that made it; it is hence that Oracles are obtained by the gold of mine Enemies, and not the voice of the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, that pronounces the fatall Ordinances of the all-powerfull Deities; it is he who envies me, my Scepter, and labours my deprivation, that he to whom <hi>Calc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> hath ſold his loyalty may uſurp it, and that you by a fancied piety ſhould become not religious, but ſuperſtitious; for certainly if I had not been choſen Generall of the Army, <hi>Cynthia</hi> would never have deſired that her Altars ſhould be adorned with my calamities; that Envy which darts Thunder-bolts upon the moſt ſupreame and exalted things hath (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that our Troops deſire of me a ſacrifice not onely abominable, but impoſſible for a Fathers affection) engaged mee to the neceſſity of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning you, to avoid that crime, or your ſelves to depoſing mee, from that dignity to which others pretend; but conſider I pray you noble Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, if it can be poſſible for that Goddeſs, the great Patroneſſe of Chaſtity, to deſigne the throat of a Nymph, of her owne traine, to be cut in revenge, for the death of a Beaſt.</p>
               <p>If the Hinde was conſecrated to <hi>Diana,</hi> to whom was dedicated the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity of <hi>Iphigenia?</hi> and what Deities are they, who expreſſe more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115194:25"/>for Beaſts then men? I know already they will ſay, it is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> deſerves, for daring to enter into a Wood conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to <hi>Diana,</hi> and more for killing her Hinde, but what correction can he deſerve, who hath committed a faulty Act, with an innocent heart? and how can hee bee guilty of irreverence that knew not the ſanctity of the place which he hath prophaned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine,</hi> I have not kill'd a ſhe Prieſt in a Temple, but a Beaſt in a Wood, and ſhall this heart, which hath alwaies reverenc'd <hi>Diana,</hi> bee implacably condemned for a light fault, and a fault not of will, but of ignorance? but if the ſin be mortall, and the puniſhment inevitable, was it ever ſeene that the gods condemned an innocent head, for the errour of a guilty hand? what? ſhall a ſpotleſs Virgin fall under a ſword, piercing her boſome? and I who committed the ſacriledge ſurvive in glory, and command an Army which is to be alwaies victorious? if it be thus, what ſhall become of juſtice?</p>
               <p>Ah! if <hi>Diana</hi> wiſheth for the head of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> ſhee wanteth not meanes to accompliſh her deſires, without imploying the aide of your ſwords: Demand of <hi>Acteon,</hi> if ſhe ever had recourſe to the aſſiſtance of men, to revenge the injuries ſhee receives in the Woods and Forreſts? returne! returne into your ſelves, O valiant Warriors, and appeaſe thoſe Furies which it may be have been provok'd, as well as the Sea for our misfortunes by a hand, which hath drawne the fury of Hell upon us; appeaſe thoſe hearts and thoſe ſpirits, who deſire unjuſtly, that the Sea ſhould bee calme, when their reaſon is overcaſt with Clouds and Tempeſts: No, no! <hi>Diana</hi> cannot hinder the revenging of a crime, wherein her Deity is more intereſſed then our ſelves, for who is there that hath ſo little judgement, as not to know how much the action of <hi>Paris</hi> hath outraged the pudicity, of which that Goddeſſe makes profeſſion? and who ſeeth not that this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher by his incontinence is as much an Enemy to <hi>Diana,</hi> as an injurer of <hi>Menelaus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if thoſe Reaſons ſeeme too remote, doe but conſider whoſe Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Helen</hi> is, for whoſe ſake all <hi>Greece</hi> is in Armes? If you anſwer me, ſhe had for her Father the Almighty <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom <hi>Diana</hi> reverenceth as her owne, what reaſon is there to oblige a Goddeſs to hinder the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man who hath diſhonoured her ſiſter? and what ſenſe is it, that one of the number of thoſe who are infinitely juſt, ſhould be agitated with a thouſand furies, to hurry her to vengeance for a yellow Beaſt? and that ſhe ſhould be ſo implacable as to deſire the death of her Neece? for if there be none that doubts, but that <hi>Helena</hi> is the ſiſter of <hi>Diana,</hi> is there any to bee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115194:25"/>found that will queſtion whether <hi>Iphigenia</hi> be her Neece or no? it may bee there is, for I ought to apprehend all things from my misfortunes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that is ill of mine Enemies.</p>
               <p>What ſay they now, after I have demoliſhed all the ſtratagems raiſed by Envy; will they yet returne and inculcate that the Heavens threaten us, that the Aire is full of Tempeſts, and that the Sea is plowed up into billows? But what! is it ſo extraordinary a Prodigy to ſee the Heavens troubled, the Windes boiſterous, and the Sea tumultuous? how is it that this Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of Oracles (as well impious towards the gods as cruell to men) how is it (I ſay) that he dares impute the impetuoſity of the Tempeſt, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of that goddeſs? by what new diviſion of the Univerſe, hath <hi>Neptune</hi> yielded the Empire of the Sea to <hi>Diana?</hi> Alas! would it had pleaſed the Deſtinies, that the moſt chaſte of all Goddeſſes had power over the Waves, they had not been croſs'd over with ſo little perill by that Adulterer, by that fugitive, that Trojan Raviſher.</p>
               <p>Wee are very ill Interpreters of the favours of the Heavens, it may bee their goodneſs not onely permits, but raiſes theſe tumultuous billowes to diſſipate the fury of the Tempeſt, which ſpent at laſt with its owne vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and impetuoſity, will afterwards permit us a Calme and proſperous paſſage; if in the change of things, a Tempeſt ſucceeds a Calme, and a Calme a Tempeſt? we muſt confeſſe that the gods who keep us now in the Port, are more favourable to us, then the Ocean, in making us expect the opportunity of a calme, and ſerene paſſage; but peradventure to maintaine their great prerogative, the gods detaine us heere, being unwilling that any other force, but their Thunder-bolts, ſhould undertake the puniſhment of ſo deteſtable an Adultery, or peradventure being pleas'd with our piety, that we, baniſhing our ſelves from our native ſoile, ſhould endure the fury of the Windes, the danger of the Sea, and the inconſtancy of the Heavens, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Houſes deſolate, and abandoning our Wives, to precipitate our ſelves into the miſeries of a painfull war, whoſe ſucceſs is uncertaine, and often depends leſs on Councell, then upon that blinde Goddeſſe Fortune, who ordinarily favours guilt more then innocence.</p>
               <p>But the Heavens defend us from a preſage ſo unlucky, wee are to hope the beſt, and we ought not to diſtruſt the juſtice of a cauſe, which if it proceed from the gods, ſhall not be without protection, the Heavens are on our ſide already, and I hope we ſhall alſo, at the laſt have the Sea: I muſt for all that confeſs, that feare and horrour invades my ſpirits as often as I repreſent the unuſuall new manner of piety, where with this wicked man pretends to appeaſe the Heavens and facilitate our Voyage, for if anger
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115194:26"/>makes this opinion, (I mean the anger of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> for onely the death of a Hinde which was hers) hath diſturb'd all the Elements, what will become of us miſerable Wretches, when wee have mutthered a Virgin ſo deare to the Goddeſs, for her Virginity, and ſo neare for her conſanguinity? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne! alas, returne (I ſay againe) to your ſelves, O valiant men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that my owne intereſts touch mee leſs then the publique: Alas I if now, when we are yet innocent, the Sea is unquiet, and the Heavens are darting Thunder bolts, what will they doe then, when they behold us cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Homicides?</p>
               <p>No, no! let our Daughters live ſafe from the violence both of men and gods; the ground of our piety, intended to be imployed for puniſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, deſerves not that the gods ſhould make us tremble, and that they ſhould render their very Altars terrible to us; ſuffer then this innocent Victime to live, that they may know what we have done a far off in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of injured vertue.</p>
               <p>The ſimplicity of my prayers with which I ſtrive to preſerve my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the hands of Envy and oppreſſion, ſhewes clearely the confidence I have in the juſtice of the Arrive Troops, your hearts have no need to bee ſoftned into mercy by my tenderneſſe; yet I would intreat with more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, if it became the quality of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to be a Suitor, and if the Grecians had ſouls, capable of ſo much baſeneſs, to follow and obey a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, I doe not deſire that my afflictions ſhould remember you that I am a Father, if that which I demand be not juſt, which if it were not, I ſhould bluſh with ſhame for intreating you, though it bee for the preſervation of a Daughter.</p>
               <p>The magnanimous; the Souldier, and even Kings themſelves, are ſubject to fatherly affection; but if in what I have ſaid, affection appeares more then juſtice, I deſire it may availe nothing, as if I had never ſpoken: I have not put you in minde of the merits of the unfortunate Maid, nor of mine owne, becauſe I deſire to owe the happy ſucceſs of my prayers to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of my cauſe, rather then to the eloquence of my language; I have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Juſtice all the actions of my life, and for the liberty and happineſs of my native Countrey.</p>
               <p>I have eſteem'd, as fortunate, all the occaſions which have ſo many times made me ſhed my bloud for the common proſperity of all <hi>Greece:</hi> but I doe not pretend that that ſhall aſſiſt me at all to preſerve my childe, if juſtice and innocence did not render her inviolable, I would not ſave her, for I am a Father, but a Father no further then the Altars, I have endeavoured onely to open your eies, that Envy and wickedneſſe triumph not under the

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Could never believe I ſhould live to ſee feare reign in the Houſe of <hi>Priam,</hi> but the more high and noble thoughts I had of the valour of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> the more unjuſtly I ſee my ſelfe reduc'd to the neceſſity of fearing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of that fortune, which hath ſo happily rais'd me to ſo ſupreame fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, a ſoule infinitely captivated with love can never feare enough: The womaniſh weakneſs of <hi>Caſſandra</hi> makes ſo much noiſe, that I fear Fortune her ſelfe envies my proſperity, but the more ſhe ſhall ſtrive to trouble my repoſe, the more vigorouſly I ſhall endeavour to oppoſe her malice, and I render thanks to <hi>Helena,</hi> who gives me occaſion to ſhew the ſtrength of my reſolution, as my election of her hath been the Argument of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant (O my Father, and you my generous Brothers) how inconſiderable a womans fears are, compar'd with the nobility of your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages; but the juſtice of my cauſe, the inclinations of my ſcule, the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King, and the ſafety of the Kingdome, are treaſures ſo precious, that we cannot be too watchfull to guard them: I know to make you draw your ſwords it is ſufficient to remember you, that the Valiant ever carry their Reaſons in their hands, and to excite you bravely to a war, it is enough to ſay it frights none but women.</p>
               <p>It is abſolutely neceſſary, that the war muſt pleaſe <hi>Hector,</hi> ſince it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> the ſoules of Heroes and thoſe of Women, are too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to have the ſame thoughts, and he that conſults the affairs of war with his Daughters, hath no great mind to fight: but I wil not that <hi>Mars</hi> ſhould overcome Juſtice; if you do not by ſolid Reaſons judge the war profitable, honeſt, and neceſſary to the reputation of the Trojan greatneſſe; the hatted betwixt the <hi>Grecian</hi> people and us hath already laſted ſo many yeares, that it being now as a naturall inclination, I ſee no likelihood of a peace, and in my opinion that is no ſmall advantage to juſtifie the war.</p>
               <p>You heare by this, whether you ought to hearken to the clamours of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> and if the generous Sentiments of <hi>Paris</hi> deſerve aſſiſtance

               <p>I might ſtrive by my ſad accents, to ſoften your hearts, and to prepare your eares favourable to my requeſts; but I doe not yet believe my ſelfe to be ſo deſerted, as to feare that I ſhall finde my Brothers wanting in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to mee, I will not eſteeme my life, if it deſerve not to be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, at leaſt by the Sentiments of Nature, and if I cannot hope that you will hearken favourably to an innocent Brother, whom ſhee injoynes you to defend, though he were guilty.</p>
               <p>But if the ſtars which reigned at my nativity were ſo fatall to have it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I ſhould feele a joy in my ſoule, to ſee a life torne from me, which my Fathers and Brothers themſelves have thought unworthy their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for <hi>in fine, Paris</hi> pretends to no other honour, but to deſerve ſome reputation among the <hi>Priams</hi> and <hi>Hectors:</hi> I parted from this River with order to treat about the ranſome of <hi>Heſione,</hi> as an Ambaſſador, or to declare war as an Enemy.</p>
               <p>My Voyage was fortunate under the conduct of the Divinity of the Sea, who foreſaw I went to be the Nephew of<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Helena</hi> was his Neece.</note>

               <p>I had recourſe to <hi>Menelans,</hi> who (though mine Enemy) was rendred favourable by her, according to what ſhe promiſed me at Mount <hi>Idae;</hi> yet I was no ſooner arrived at his houſe, but to evade the importunity of my requeſts, hee abſented himſelfe upon the falſe pretence of ſome affaires, which diſcovered to mee, that I had beene brought into his houſe rather by the force of Deſtiny, then by his curteſie, all his whole Pallace (even out of their innate hatred to our Nation) comported themſelves towards me, as if I had been their particular Enemy, there was none ſave onely this Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Princeſſe <hi>Helena,</hi> in whom I could diſcover common humanity, ſhee knew at firſt the equity of my demands, and I found her as favourable as the juſtice of my Cauſe deſerved, or any moderate heart could deſire: it is true, that my obſervation of it had no ſooner encountred thoſe faire eyes, (for compariſon of whom, it is too much to name the Divinity, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely too little to thinke of any thing we ſee upon Earth) but I preſently apprehended a way in her to ballance the unjuſt detenſion of her I came for;

               </p>
               <p>It was thence I laid my deſigne in favour of your Empire; but my heart had ſcarcely received the image of that glorious object preſented to mine eyes, but I reſolved to mingle my particular inclinations with the publique intereſt, ſo that having for my object a face too faire for expreſſion, the <hi>Idea</hi> was no ſooner received into my breaſt, but <hi>Helen</hi> was inthroned in my heart, not onely amongſt my affections, but divinities, for to know the glory and greatneſs of her beauty, you may but conſider it was I that made choiſe of it, I, that came from ſeeing that of <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tumultuous imbtoylment that her taking away raiſed through all <hi>Greece,</hi> may teach you (O my Brothers) to know the value of the perſon, and how much ſhe deſerves, whoſe abſence alone hath put ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces into Armes to recover her; I know not better how to boaſt to you the perfections of this excellent Lady, then in remembring you that ſhe is the very recompence promiſed me by the Goddeſs <hi>Venus;</hi> and how can we more ſeverely revenge ſo many outrages, receiv'd from the injurious hands of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> then in depriving them of a Treaſure which dazled the eyes of a man newly come from beholding without aſtoniſhment, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the prime beauties of Heaven; what ſhall ſtay us lazy, vile, feeble, (and that which I eſteem yet more ſhamefull to our great ſoules) inſenſible men, to dwell under ſuch indignities without vengeance?

No, no! the prize I have taken can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be retained at a leſſe rate then the hazard of a Kingdome; the greatneſs of the hazard will ſet the greater reputation upon our honour, rather then to be a ſubject of fear, or terror to generous ſouls; the more dangerous and difficult things are, the more vertuous actions are enobled by being verſed in them, and when I conſider well the eſtate of this affaire, my ſoule is vexed that neither by the condition of our matters, as they are, nor by the will of the gods, the war that the <hi>Greeks</hi> threaten us withall, cannot be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger great enough to render us worthy detainers of that ſoveraigne piece of excellence, beyond which there is nothing to be deſired, by thoſe who have eyes, of ſoules able to judge; what ought we to feare? it may be you will ſay the Forces of falling <hi>Achaya,</hi> or thoſe of miſerable <hi>Sparta;</hi> No, no! my Brothers, either <hi>Mars</hi> muſt be a <hi>Trojan,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> will ſhew to us, that ingratitude reignes even in Heaven, but (my Brothers) thoſe ought not to feare the fury of <hi>Mars</hi> who have <hi>Venus</hi> for their Protectreſs; the poverty
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115194:28"/>of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Kingdomes permits no one of their Kings to aſſault us alone, and if divers Princes compoſe the number of our Enemies, it cannot bee but very happy for us.</p>
               <p>Divers are the <hi>Graecian</hi> Princes, and all of them have without doubt more vanity then valour; who will there bee amongſt them that will yield the Empire of himſelfe to one that hee believes not his ſuperiour; nothing is more hard to reconcile, then the opinions of a multitude, and how much harder will it bee, when the queſtion ſhall ariſe about the command of an Army wherein the danger of all parties is concern'd: ſome will prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, ſome unable; the former loath to ingage themſelves in a warr, the other not in a capacity to undertake it; there is no man ſo happy in his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, that all men ſhould beare a part in his diſaſters; <hi>Menelaus</hi> hath his Enemies in <hi>Greece</hi> as well as wee, thoſe who are unwilling to ſee him proſperous, will divert his forces, hinder his reliefe, and prove rather ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then Enemies to our ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>But what is at length become of the uſuall gallantry, and ancient repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Monarchy, dreaded to that extreame part of our world, where the Land ends, ſo much reverenced through the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? and though not onely <hi>Greece</hi> alone, but all <hi>Affrick</hi> ſhould joyne with her, and take up Armes againſt us, muſt <hi>Aſia</hi> therefore run away beyond the knowne limits of the World, where are ſo many tributary Kingdomes allyed and united aſwell by the bonds of Nature as Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt?</p>
               <p>There is not one of theſe Neighbour Princes, but will feare the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor one that will nor remember the Favours that he hath received from the <hi>Trojans;</hi> where ſhall be that <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which never found the pleaſure of Love, but in the Trojan beauties? where ſhall bee that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which holds not her Scepter, and reigne over beauty, but from my judgement? it was ſhe which promis'd mee <hi>Helen</hi> for the Companion of my life, and her ſelfe to be my Protectreſs, let thoſe alone diſtruſt the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of my cauſe, who believe not the oathes of the gods.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> as yet, have not aſſembled their Troops, nor ſo much as ſent forth their Commiſſions to forme their Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Victualled any Navy for their tranſportment, nor paſt over ſo many Seas, which ſeperate our Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories from theirs, wherein they will have need of the conduct of their beſt ſtars, to performe ſo long a Voyage, without great dangers, at leaſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; wee ſhall have famine, and ſickneſs, windes, and Seas, Heavens, and ſeaſons, diſorder, and diſcordance fight for us.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:115194:29"/>
               <p>But if all the powers of Heaven and Earth ſhould be againſt us, and that we ſhould be utterly without Forces capable to defend us, what ought we to doe? ought we to let ſucceeding ages finde in Story that the Kings of <hi>Troy</hi> ſo long evill treated, injured, and (which is yet more ſhamefull) ſcorn'd by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> not only to leave ſo many outrages unrevenged, but to tremble at the very threats of the Enemy? and after having by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of heaven, in this one action of mine, repaired all our loſſes, to yield back timerouſly, without fighting, ſuch an ineſtimable booty? we owe! (O my Brothers) we owe higher reſentments to the greatneſs of our births; for my part, I will not be affrighted with this vaine womans Predictions, and I abhor the onely thought that the heart of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould be daunted, being onely informed from the feares of a young Girle, that the Enemy threatned to be revenged.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, becauſe our Enemies threaten I feare a great deale the leſſe, we ought to feare thoſe, whoſe words are actions, not thoſe, whoſe actions are words; whoſoever endeavours to abaſe me with lower thoughts, let him firſt take from my memory, that I am the ſon of a <hi>Priam,</hi> for the nobleneſs of my extraction, and the meanneſs of ſuch thoughts are not compatible: No, no! I ſhall never be capable of ſo degenerate an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to her, who hath ſo nobly expreſt her affection to me, my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and its injuries.</p>
               <p>What may all the world ſay, if <hi>Paris</hi> for a few threats ſhould returne her back againe to <hi>Greece,</hi> who turn'd Fugitive for his love, and is recall'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for puniſhment, then for conſolation with her Husband? what? ought I to betray, and abandon her, who, was the onely perſon in all <hi>Greece,</hi> that would have afforded juſtice to the Trojans? ſhe who ſcorning her<note n="*" place="margin">Jupiter.</note> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers anger, and the fury of her Husband, left thoſe unjuſt people, and came with me upon my word? what god would leave, ſo many oathes violated, after the faith that I ingaged, unpuniſhed? I bluſh with ſhame to thinke that I have ſuffered great <hi>Helena</hi> to intreat for the ſafety of that Perſon, who hath ſav'd the honor of the Trojan Empire.</p>
               <p>Which of you (O my generous Brothers) would not eſteem vilely of me, if I ſhould ſhamefuly conſent that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould ſee his Daughter betray'd by us, and betray'd, at a time, when ſhe rather is to be adored, then aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? then ſhall we be leſſe afraid of the vengeance of the gods, then of the Princes of <hi>Argos?</hi> ſhall the <hi>Grecian</hi> faith, hitherto ſo infamous, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ours, and mark our Names with a Character ſo black, that future Ages will make a proverb of the abomination of our infidelity? thus then wee may behold the <hi>Grecians</hi> to triumph over <hi>Troy,</hi> before they have drawne
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115194:29"/>their ſwords; No, no! (my Brothers) we ought not to put ſhame, and life into the ſame Ballance together, we ought to reſolve to loſe the one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, rather then preſerve the other with ſuch ignominy.</p>
               <p>But admit my ſentiments were not governed by Juſtice, how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (O my Brothers) that <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould be ſo little conſidered by you, hee who would ſacrifice his life with ſo much alacrity, for the eſtabliſhment of your felicity, he I ſay, that muſt without doubt die, if he ſee raviſhed from him, the onely thing, next his noble Brothers, which makes him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helena</hi> is a Beauty created by the gods, as a Maſter piece to expreſs their power, all hearts, that are not raviſh'd with ſo divine an object, are too neare inſenſibility; our Daughters deſire not her abſence, but our of envy to her perfections, their eies cannot ſuffer the fairneſs of her complexion, which in whiteneſs ſurpaſſeth the feathers of that beautifull<note n="*" place="margin">The Swan.</note> Bird, whoſe forme <hi>Jupiter</hi> aſſum'd, when he ſolaced himſelfe with her<note n="*" place="margin">Leda.</note> Mother; Oh! how, by the malicous ſpirit of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> is the dreame of <hi>Hecuba</hi> miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, that a ſlame kindled by the hand of <hi>Paris,</hi> was to conſume to aſhes the Empire of <hi>Priam?</hi> which rightly interpreted intends nothing but the bright beames of <hi>Hellena's</hi> beauty, which we cannot behold, but the whole Empire muſt be inflamed by her.</p>
               <p>I might feare leſt my paſſion, or to ſay better, my tenderneſs doth render me too ſenſible for that royall perſon, if I did not remember, that even by gratitude, and acknowledgement of her high merit, I owe this returne to that <hi>Helena,</hi> whoſe eyes, full of love, and pitty, regarded the juſtneſſe of my cauſe, and alone conſidered the danger to which I was expos'd, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the deſigne of my Voyage; <hi>Helena!</hi> who borne our Enemy, was no ſooner entreated to lend her aſſiſtance for the protection of the <hi>Trojan</hi> greatneſs, but ſhe had compaſſion on our ſufferings, and my honour; on the contrary, <hi>Caſſandra</hi> (my ſiſter) no ſooner ſaw my returne, but ſhe envied my ſucceſſe, and endeavoured to ingage all the world to leave me in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>What action, if not this, can be thought diſhoneſt if I ſhould faile in my faith to her, who though (at that time) an Enemy, hath expreſt more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of my honour then mine owne ſiſter, who is thereunto by the bond of Nature obliged? I ſay againe I might feare that my paſſion blinded me, and made me love her perſon wantonly, if I knew not that I am obliged to love her, more, by the generoſity of my ſoule, then by the charmes of her incomparable beauty; I love not alone in her thoſe attractions, which will be effaced by time, but I love to be the ſon in Law of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> I love to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115194:30"/>have my Children on both ſides of the bloud of the gods: <hi>In fine,</hi> either the election of <hi>Paris</hi> is good, or the great majeſty of the gods ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>I might have an ill opinion of my flame, if I did not know it to be kindled by the ordinance of the Deſtinies, and that its originall is from heaven; when <hi>Venus</hi> obtained by my judgement the prize to which ſhe pretended, ſhe made me read her thankfulneſs written in Characters indeleble; <hi>Paris</hi> (ſaid ſhe) thou ſhalt love, and thou ſhalt love that <hi>Helena</hi> ſo worthy of thy flames, whom <hi>Menelaus</hi> keeps for thy Nuptials; who then ſhall deprive me of a Legacy, which the Heavens not onely bequeath'd mee, but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>Helena</hi> was borne for <hi>Paris?</hi> and to know her value, conſider ſhee is choſen by a Goddeſs, as the moſt precious reward to gratifie a man, that had ſerv'd her in an affaire of ſuch importance, that it troubled the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the gods.</p>
               <p>This in my opinion is enough for my juſtification; but if the infatuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Caſſandra</hi> ſuggeſts it a great crime, to ſeduce a Beauty from the Houſe of her Husband, and that ſhee reproaches mee with violating the ſacred Laws of Hoſpitality, and cites <hi>Jupiter</hi> incenſed for that, and the rape of his Daughter? conſider, I beſeech you, that the Deſtinies, not <hi>Menelaus,</hi> made entertainment for me in <hi>Argos,</hi> and that in committing an act of affection, I have performed one of obedience; <hi>Helen</hi> hath been waited on by me, not raviſh'd, ſhe is not raviſh'd who conſents, nor is ſhe a Beauty to be rendred back if ſhe had been ſtolne, this would be an injury to <hi>Venus,</hi> if I ſhould goe about to mend her election, and neglect her decree; I deny not but ſuch a Beauty deſerves to be a thouſand times raviſhed; I appeal to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who, after he had been preſerved from the ſulphure of Hell, could not behold, without paſſion, the face of this <hi>Helen,</hi> who to ſhew her birth carrieth her lightning in her Eyes, as her Father doth his thunder in his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helena</hi> was return'd back by <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that ſhe might ever be retained by <hi>Paris;</hi> or rather ſhe was returned backe, becauſe his eyes accuſtomed to the obſcurity of Hell, could not indure the brightneſs of hers; for my part I know no Reaſon why <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould bee leſſe willing to ſee his Daughter married to <hi>Paris,</hi> then to <hi>Menelaus:</hi> How is it poſſible (I ſay) that <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> shall be offended with me, who hath ſo much valued his Race, that I have deemed it worthy, even with ſo much perill, of being ravished? how shall it not pleaſe him to ſee his Daughter beloved and married into a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hath produc'd Children worthy of the love and rape of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe?</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:115194:30"/>
               <p>Thou didſt raviſh from us (O great god) our Ginimede, and by thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I have raviſhed thy <hi>Helena;</hi> who can doubt that my theft is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the gods, ſince I did it not but to imitate them? why thinke you (O <hi>Trojans</hi>) that <hi>Jupiter</hi> declar'd me the moſt ſufficient of all men to be the Judge between the three Goddeſſes? it was to juſtifie his amorous Thefts, before the world, for in declaring me to be the wiſeſt of all mankinde, hee juſtified his Thefts, ſince they are imitated by the juſteſt of all Judges: Alas! all eyes have not opticks ſtrong enough, to gaze againſt ſuch a Beauty, and all Eagles cannot ſtare upon the Sun.</p>
               <p>If the gods had been angry with me, they would not have permitted my returne to have been ſo happy, nor have calmed the Seas in favour of my Navigation; ſo that if you have no ſtronger motives to induce you to feare, it may be call'd as unjuſt as feeble; bee victorious (O my Brothers) for if you ſhall diſpute whether it be neceſſary to returne <hi>Helena,</hi> there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that will ever believe, that any thing but feare makes you leave a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and render back a Jewell, which is of value ſufficient to recompence all your loſſes, and reſtore your honours; for my part, I apprehend not how, in the family of<note n="*" place="margin">The ſon of <hi>Tios</hi> their Anceſtor.</note>

               <p>The moſt part of thoſe Actions that valour renders ſo glorious, would have little reaſon of their ſides, if they were ſcinned by the Rules of exact Juſtice, all the ill in the rape of <hi>Helena</hi> is blotted out by Time, we muſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it by Armes, not by a poore repentance; if we raſhly reſtore her, we ſhall diſcover to the Greeks, that we can be forc'd, and that we may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</p>

               <p>The violence of ſo many united Provinces, which are confederated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for our Ruines, is the leaſt evill, which can come, to diſturb the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Kingdome; <hi>Caſſandra</hi> weeps in vaine to make me afraid, the <hi>Greeks</hi> make a noiſe, and the Heavens themſelves threaten; I have a heart as great as yours, and cannot feare death, I can be as jealous of honour as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, if the Sentiments of <hi>Paris</hi> endangered nothing but life, happy that life, which ſhould bee loſt for the felicity of <hi>Paris,</hi> whom wee all love; but what will ſucceeding Ages ſay, when they know that we have imbroyl'd the whole Univerſe, to maintaine the paſſion of one, moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, who could love nothing but an Enemy? What will all the Earth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115194:32"/>ſay of our injuſtice, when they ſhall ſee us defend a man that could not love without raviſhing, and could not raviſh without violating his faith, and who could not violate his faith without ingaging his Countrey to a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, and that could not ingage his Countrey, his Family, himſelfe, his Kingdome, for a more illuſtrious occaſion then the love of a Woman, and which is yet worſe, an Adultreſs, a Fugitive, and a Enemy? Oh unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Veſſell in which <hi>Helens</hi> ſhame was conducted to our ſhores! it ſhall not be imputed to <hi>Troylus,</hi> if <hi>Paris</hi> doe not acknowledge Continence to be the moſt amiable vertue that can beautifie and become with better Reaſon grow in amoured with her, then he is now of his <hi>Helen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou wert choſen to negotiate for the returne of <hi>Heſione,</hi> a <hi>Trojan,</hi> home to us from <hi>Greece,</hi> and thou haſt not onely fail'd of that truſt, but <hi>Paris</hi> himſelfe is become a <hi>Grecian:</hi> conſider, I pray thee, that thou haſt not only fail'd in declaring to the <hi>Greeks</hi> their injuſtice, but thou haſt diſhonoured the juſt pretence the <hi>Trojans</hi> had to make warre upon them; to whom of all the gods ought we any more to have recourſe, to implore reliefe againſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> that have raviſhed our Daughters? ſhall it bee to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe Daughter hath been raviſhed, and whoſe Son in Law ingratefully betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? why! he is obliged to arm his all powerfull hand with vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; judge then (O <hi>Paris</hi>) of the juſtneſs of thy Cauſe, and of thy diſobligements to us, and our Nations, thou haſt depriv'd thy Countrey of the aſſiſtance of the gods, and thou knoweſt none can bee more accurſed then thoſe who in extreame calamities, cannot at leaſt preſume to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the immortall Powers; even this is alſo raviſh'd from us by thee; and yet thou wouldſt have us approve, and comply with thy actions, the thought of which is abominable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heſione,</hi> being compell'd to marry a <hi>Grecian,</hi> is bewayl'd and wept for by us, as for a principall limb lopt off from our body, and ſhall we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoyce, but become Idolaters and ſlaves to a <hi>Grecian,</hi> the high way to ruine? God forbid: the Trojan Troops ſhould ever fight ingloriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrange Enſignes; <hi>Troylus</hi> had rather ſee the Kingdome of <hi>Laonudon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Spoiles of <hi>Mars,</hi> then amongſt the Trophies of a <hi>Grecian,</hi> hee will never endure to behold the Empire of <hi>Troy</hi> envaſſail'd by the ſparkling eyes of a charming Fugitive, to beare diſhonourable chaines, and to fall, for the love of them into the formidable diſpleaſure of an incenſed Fate.</p>
               <p>If theſe evils (O <hi>Paris</hi>) are not ſupportable which are believ'd leaſt ſhamefull, we ſhould offer vowes to Fortune, that our Countrey rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, by the flame of our Enemies, then by thoſe of thine incontinency, but if the injuſtice of thy action, the feare of the gods, the danger of our

I bluſh to ſee a Councell of Kings aſſembled to debate the queſtion, whether the peace and happineſs of ſo many Kingdomes ought to be preferr'd before one Woman, who alſo is our Enemy, certainly ſo dead-killing a Thunder-bolt could never fall, but from a very incenſed Heaven, nor could theſe diſoders ever proceed, but from woman, who is the miſtake of guilty Nature.</p>
               <p>What? upon the arbitration, or rather the tyranny of one woman, ought the fate of ſo many Provinces to depend, and be reduc'd to ſigh out their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities? O Victimes too noble for ſo unworthy an<note n="*" place="margin">Ladies, I would not have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted this, but that the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor meanes this only of the Italian women, he could never intend it to the Engliſh.</note> Idol! O Sex dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in all times, in all places! who cannot bee beloved without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and cannot love without Tyranny; conſider <hi>Paris</hi> how vile the cauſe is, which produceth ſuch ſad effects, that the Hiſtories of all Ages, and of all Nations, ſhall bewaile our miſeries, whoſoever will learne that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that killing Monſter, was created for nothing elſe but to puniſh the world, let them conſider the ſtrange condition of <hi>Aſia,</hi> at this day.</p>
               <p>A chaſte Woman is a Rock, an unchaſte one a Quickſand; a courſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is nauſcious, a faire one, an Inchantreſs; if thou lov'ſt her, ſhe is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelfe; if thou ſlighteſt her, ſhe is a fury; all her inclinations are mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe loves not without ſelfe ends, ſhe ſpeaks not without feigning, and under her ſmiles lurks deceit, ingratitude reignes in her heart, and if incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy be a corporeall ſubſtance, Woman is inconſtancy it ſelfe, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was never knowing man, that ever loved Woman, that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to finde faith in that Sex; her heart is as deceitfull, as her face: Vipers, venemous Serpents, and Aſpes are Monſters I confeſs, but Monſters which deceive not, they, in only ſhewing themſelvs, premonish thee to flie, but Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man allures thee as a Goddeſs, &amp; poyſons thee as a Baſilisk, ſhe is, I ſay, the Error of Nature, a chaſtiſement to the World, an infaſcination to the Eye; ſhe hath no qualities that are not wicked and dangerous, her ſeeming Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are adulterate, and in burying themſelves under ſo much Ceruſe and Vermillion, doe they not ſeem to confeſs, that they are indeed what they are aſham'd to appeare?</p>
               <p>Behold <hi>Paris!</hi> from whom thou expects faith, it is even from thoſe whoſe very faces are counterfet, and deceitfull, and whoſe complexion compos'd of ſublimate, can have nothing but poyſon in her beauty: have they one haire that Nature hath plac'd as we ſee it? no, no, <hi>Paris!</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115194:33"/>all is artificiall in them, I pray then judge what kinde of creature Woman muſt needs be, that is never contented with her ſelfe, but when ſhe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her ſelfe, to what end ſerve ſo many Jewels, which Womens luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath made precious? theſe magnificent creatures could not be covered, if they did not reverſe the mountains, trouble the Seas, becauſe they would rather load their bodies, then not adorne them; how is it poſſible, that for a beauty ſo counterfeit, ſo falſe, and ſo dangerous, a generous man ſhould ſo far loſe his Reaſon, and the Empire of himſelfe, as not to live comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to die triumphing?</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible (I ſay) that Woman the moſt weake, the moſt falſe, the moſt cruell, and the moſt inconſtant of all other animals, ſhould cauſe at this day the ruine of <hi>Aſia?</hi> What? ſhall the ſtate and life of <hi>Priam;</hi> and the illuſtrious deſtiny of <hi>Troy,</hi> hang upon thoſe haires, which it may be are borrowed from thoſe which make Perrukes? Returne! returne into thy ſelfe, O noble Brother, and let not future Ages know, that thou didſt prefer in thy ſoule, the love of a Fugitive, before the affection thou oweſt to thy Countrey; thou haſt but too much already ſubjected thy judgement to thine Eyes, although no other thing but Reaſon ought to command him, who is borne to command; if thou loveſt war, thou haſt a Enemy within thee, whom to ſubdue will be thine eternall honour; paſſion by growing old, will be enfeebled, and yield to time, as well as all other things; if this be true, as certainly it is, were it not better that the honour of this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be thine, then that thou ſhouldſt owe it to Time?</p>
               <p>Conſider that this beauty is the beauty of an Adultreſs, who was likewiſe her ſelfe, begot in the ſame crime, a beauty unfaithfull to her owne Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the beauty of an Enemy even to thy ſelfe; the more faire ſhe is, the more ſhamefully ſhe hath darkened, by her incontinency, the luſtre of ſo divine a donative; ſhee is faire I confeſſe, but faire more for the ruine, then for the delight of thoſe that behold her,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that rendred her back, knew how ſhee was to bee valued, and we may ſay, ſhe is a Sun, which who can gaze on, but he muſt diſtill tears? ſo wilt thou my Brother, I feare conſidering the imbroylment ſhe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd a many of Nations in; ſhe is faire thou ſayeſt, and it is becauſe ſhe is faire, that I think we ought to returne her; why ſhouldſt thou nouriſh a Serpent in thy boſome, whoſe venome is inevitable? ought we to believe, that that beauty will live more honourably in the Houſe of an Adulterer, then in that of her Husband? her Father hath ſeen her follow <hi>Theſeus,</hi> her Husband ſeeth her follow <hi>Paris,</hi> and undoubtedly <hi>Paris</hi> will ſee her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſome other.</p>

               <p>What? can wee hope to ſee <hi>Helen</hi> chaſte? the impunity of her ſinning hath taught her that ſhee may ſin without puniſhment; if wee leave her to her owne liberty, ſhe will not onely reigne over us, but ſhe will eſtabliſh her tyranny to overwhelme us, to our diſhonours; if we ſhould reſtraine her, we ſhould force her to commit thoſe ſtolne ſcapes, to which liberty will cary her more openly; for my part, I confeſs, I ſhould doubt leſt ſhe had brought with her the <hi>Grecian</hi> perfidy, feigning to be an Enemy to her Countrey, to the end that ſhe might ruine ours, if I did not ſee our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is already turn'd <hi>Greece,</hi> ſince our Kings are under the obedience of a <hi>Grecian</hi> Woman, and at this rate ſhe would but betray her ſelfe by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ilion.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>in fine,</hi> whether theſe walls fall by her treaſon, or whether they fall by the force of the Enemies, it is certaine they are menaced with a fall ſo much more dreadfull as we have deſerved it, by the injuſtice of his Action, and by our ſupine ſtupidity, having been premoniſhed of the malignance of our Deſtinies by the Praedictions of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> and by the portentious ſignes obſerved in Heaven, which threaten us every day; I know very well, that, according to the inclinations of thy ſeduced heart, all theſe omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous things are held vaine, for Love is a Fury, and the furious, or men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, favour neither of reaſon nor Religion, they feare not the menaces of the gods, whereupon, I conclude, that we ought not to follow thy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and that is moſt fit to uſe thee as a man frantick, to tie thy hands for thy ſafety.</p>
               <p>Alas! with how little Reaſon doſt thou believe thy ſelfe ingaged to be gratefull to the friendſhip of this <hi>Helena,</hi> who hath onely inſnared, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thee? <hi>Helena</hi> was inclin'd to love, not by a ſentiment of compaſſion to thy flames, but to qualifie her owne hot appetite, ſhe was excited by her inate Vice, not moved by any tenderneſs to <hi>Paris;</hi> if thou art afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingratefull in Vice? thou haſt here found the meanes to be vitious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of Vertue, and 'tis rather to outſtrip <hi>Helen</hi> in inconſtancy then gratitude.</p>
               <p>Love is not a benefit, he layes an obligation that takes paines for another, but the Lover acts ſimply for himſelfe: The particular pleaſure from the party beloved reflects back upon the Lover, is that which love propoſeth for its end.</p>

               <p>I am demanded which of theſe two actions ſet the moſt lively gloſs upon the rayes of that Vertue, which made them thus ſcorne, deſerve, and give Principalities; it is for you (O Courteous Auditors) to weigh them, that you may know their value; for my part, I will bee the Advocate to alledge Reaſons on both ſides, and I will leave the cenſure of them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt whom <hi>Alexander</hi> may not make exception, and from whoſe judgement the Philoſopher need not appeale; thoſe who are evill looke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with an eye of Envy upon great things, they ſay that it was too much to give a City, and that it was (if I may ſo ſpeak) like money, out of a Palſey hand, rather falling then given, but that which wee give to a good man is never too much; he who deſerves all, can never receive enough, and if a City may not be given to a Philoſopher who knew how to govern it, to whom ſhould it be given? it is not a gift ſaith he, which agreeth with my quality; ingratefull man! thy quality is, that <hi>Alexander</hi> judgeth thee worthy; the favour of the King carrieth with it thy fortune; doſt thou not ſee how the Vertue, of this great Captaine, ſhines in all things? knoweſt thou not that the generous conſidereth all as nothing? another might have obliged thee by the quality of the gift, this brave man obligeth thee by his opinion in eſteeming thee worthy; ſo that it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the gift is too great, but it is becauſe thou art a thing too little; for, the favour of the Prince ſupplies thy want of merit, if the gift agreeth not with thy condition, make thy gratitude agree with it; wee ought not to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115194:36"/>render as vaine the actions of Princes, eſpecially when they tend to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is ſo much more deare to him as he purſues it more ardently: a noble Prince is a good ſtar, whoſe every influence is a Treaſure; <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> wanted nothing in this concurrence, but another <hi>Alexander;</hi> there were no Eyes upon Earth worthy ſo glorious an object; for a City to bee given with as good a will, as others receive it, is a thing which was never ſeene but once.</p>
               <p>All the Captains in the Army of <hi>Alexander</hi> might know how to take a City, but never any but <hi>Alexander</hi> knew how to give one: I have heard this Philoſopher commended for ſo little eſteeming a gift ſo magnificent, as a City; and why doe they not celebrate the praiſes of that <hi>Alexander,</hi> who knew how to diſpoile himſelfe of Kingdoms, to reward the vertue of ſuch as could likewiſe ſcorne even Scepters?</p>
               <p>Vertue they ſay, was the cauſe why that good man had no need of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like Vertue made <hi>Alexander</hi> have need to give it to ſuch a one as this man appear'd to be; ſhall I ſpeak as I think? it was not <hi>Alexander</hi> that was vain-glorious in giving a Principality, but the other in refuſing it; that ſubtile man would not onely ſhew his poverty, but hee would doe it with vanity, and why did hee call that neceſſity which hee made his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? he ſhewed not his poverty, but his vain-glory, he beg'd but to have the opportunity to refuſe; why did hee make this uſe of his preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? it ſeemes his indigence was his wealth, not his want: he may well purchaſe nakedneſſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was no want here, but of Vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this Vice was ſo much the greater, that could finde out a place for pride and vain-glory, even in ſtraw and hunger: It was not Philoſophy which ſlighted that City, but Ambition; Philoſophy would have taught him to accept it rather, then to have beene ungratefull to the bounty of his King; hee had not wanted meanes to have been delivered from the burthen of it, if it had been too weighty for him; he might have imployd it in redeeming the afflicted out of captivity, in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thouſands of perſons, he might have oblig'd his friends; indeed, what might he not have done?</p>
               <p>It is more likely that hee, who nobly gives away his goods, doth as hee ought, then hee who refuſeth them, after hee hath ask'd an Almes; who knows but that he refus'd out of a doubt that he was mock'd, or out of a feare, that it was onely to tempt him? who knowes but that feeble ſoule might bee dazled with the brightneſs of ſo great a generoſity? wee cannot make Images of all ſorts of Wood, and all ſoules are not capable of

I! I ſay who am ſuch a perſon, to be put in ballance with one good for nothing, but himſelfe, who refus'd this Maſſe of Treaſure onely for feare of being thought to depend upon another, and who avoided not the command of a City, but to ſerve himſelfe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſort of ambition? theſe are the tears I ſhould ſhed, if I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be <hi>Alexander.</hi>

               <p>O inclination truly royall! I will now ceaſe to wonder why hee deſir'd to ſearch for new Worlds, but the wonder is, how hee could chance upon a ſoule ſo meane, as to judge that the gift of a City, was exceſſive, comming from a King who found the world too little (though hee conquered it) to give away.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever accuſeth <hi>Alexander</hi> of Prodigality, knoweth not the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſoule; the leaſt Almes that could enter into his thoughts to give to ſuch a perſon was a City: Thoſe who upbraid him of being profuſe, are unacquainted either with his Vertue, or Fortune; the bounds of his Empire were the bounds of the Earth; that part of Nature which would not be ſubject to <hi>Alexander,</hi> was retired (if I may ſo ſay) beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>To ſum up all, <hi>Alexander</hi> was greater for the World, then the World was for <hi>Alexander;</hi> ſo that a vulgar liberality, had not ſuited with a ſoule ſo Princely: if his Majeſty, Wiſedome, Fortitude, and his many other royall indowments ought to ſurpaſs private actions, why not his munificence? Royall gifts ought to carry with them the majeſty of the King which gives them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> would never let any man implore his bounty in vaine, hee met their demands with the ſame cheerfulneſs, that others doe favours; his liberality never troubled him, but when he wanted a ſubject to expreſs it on: In a word (O illuſtrious Auditors) would you know the true degree of his magnificence, he gave away more then could bee received? neither doe I ſee that the bounty of Heaven expreſſeth it ſelfe in ſuch a degree as Envy would ſeem to reproach <hi>Alexander</hi> withall: the Sun makes no ſuch diſtinction of perſons, but gives light equally to all.</p>
               <p>But I know how it comes to paſs, that they murmur ſo at that liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they are vexed for not being borne in that Age, and believe it too great becauſe it is without Example, and remember not that the magnimity of <hi>Alexander</hi> is without Example; behold a reproach well grounded that they ſpeake ill of that, they could not ſhare in; O falſe underſtanding of things I hee gave more then can bee parralleld, we are in no very ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince our acception only is abundance.</p>
               <p>But it is time I make an end of ſpeaking for <hi>Alexander;</hi> I ſhould injure his Vertue, if I believ'd that his praiſes could be contain'd in this Diſcourſe, that Vertue is little conſiderable which can bee expreſs'd by praiſes; thoſe of <hi>Alexanders</hi> were no ſuch: one ask'd him an Almes, and he gave him a City; thinke with your ſelves, O noble Auditors, who could have a heart more royall, then his whoſe very Almes are whole Cities?</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:115194:37"/>
               <p>But who ſhall ſpeak in favour of that poore Philoſopher to whom it was no ſmall advantage, that Fortune had rais'd <hi>Alexander</hi> to ſo ſupreame a height, as to be able to give away Cities, to give him opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Vertue by a refuſall? let him defend himſelfe, for I will not bee accus'd of a raſh undertaking; yet if a Philoſopher hath need of defence, who will not be ready to take his part, though hee himſelfe is better able to defend himſelfe?</p>
               <p>That man ask'd an Almes of <hi>Alexander, Alexander</hi> gave him a City, the Philoſopher refus'd it, as a thing not ſuitable to his condition, with a grace ſo full of majeſty, that hee appear'd rather a King, then a miſerable Beggar: Fortune was not unkinde in depreſſing a man, who was able to tread her under his foot.</p>
               <p>Me thinks I heare him ſay, I thank you, but I have not a ſoule ambitious of command, I have implored the charity, not the magnificence of the King; if thou hadſt enabled me only to buy me a Cloake, thou hadſt plentifully ſatisfied my hopes, I will not quit my poverty, it ſufficeth me to have my ſoule inrich'd with Vertue; in that, and not in the goods of Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts my felicity: I eſteem it not a charity in them, that would deprive mee of my Peace; a City is too much for him, who is contented with himſelf, I would not have my Eſtate more valuable, then my ſelf, it being a thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous, for a Maſter to be in worſe condition then his Slave, ſo miſerable is he, whoſe patrimony is nobler then his ſoule; I ask peace in my neceſſity, not trouble to my repoſe, I have not need of Kingdomes, I have enough to doe to reigne over my ſelfe, or rather I enjoy an Empire, which is not ſubject to the injuries of Fortune.</p>
               <p>Indeed my Eſtate is ſmall, but withall ſecure; what happineſs is it to me to have a large and ſumptuous bed, if I cannot ſleep? or what's the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be ſhipwrack'd in a great and guilded ſhip, or a petty Pinck? why then ſhould my life be more deare in a royall pallace then in my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? No, no! if I am juſt, I ſhall not be poore, and if I am not juſt, what ſhould I doe with a City? I ſhall be but a Viper in a Veſſel of gold, who, for all that, will not be leſſe dangerous, leſſe venemous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> thou haſt us'd mee like <hi>Polierates,</hi> but I will not uſe thee like <hi>Anacreon,</hi> when I ſhall not bee able to ſleep without thinking of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thy City back unto thee, in doing whereof thou wilt eſteem me either little generous in my command, or very inconſiderate, in accepting ſuch a gift.</p>

               <p>Thus is mine opinion he might diſcourſe, who poſſeſt in himſelfe both a King and a Kingdom: Behold how deplorable humane Nature is, and what diſcord it carries within it ſelfe: <hi>Alexander</hi> laviſh'd away a thouſand lives to win a City, which a poore Philoſopher was aſhamed to receive by way of gift; <hi>Alexander</hi> thought to ſurmount that man by an Act, as of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the World, but that man confounded <hi>Alexander</hi> by an Act, as of one Maſter of himſelfe.</p>

               <p>BY the ſword of an infernal Fury (for illuſtrious Auditors, no other but a Fury, would ever have had the cruelty to ſhed the bloud of a faire Lady,) by the ſword I ſay, of a Monſter come from Hell, 3 unfortunate Lovers ſaw their Miſtris wounded, which fel at the feet of that Barbarian: the firſt mov'd by generoſity and love, drew his ſword, and ran after that baſe aſſaſſinate that ran away, to ſacrifice him to his anger, and to revenge her whom he adored: the ſecond flew to her reliefe: but the third, out of a ſenſe of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115194:40"/>and griefe, fell in a ſwound, and verified that ancient poſition, which aſſures, that the ſoule ſubſiſts more, where it loves, then where it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
               <p>I am under your command to examine, which of theſe reſentments ought to be preferr'd, though I am unable, yet I obey willingly, for who would not willingly obey the commands of thoſe, who have the goodneſs to be ſatisfied with obedience onely? I am proud of this command, though I know, I undergo it not, but with the hazard of that reputation, you vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me; for ſpeaking in ſo high a place, I ought to feare a Precipice, but the dangers to which we are expoſed by knowledge, are ſo noble, and ſo glorious, that we never ought to eſchew them.</p>
               <p>I would to Heaven, and my good Stars, that I were able to performe it as I ought, I ſhall cheerfully doe the beſt I can; I am too much obliged to the curteſie of a City, whoſe leaſt honour and glory, is to have fill'd all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope with the wealth of <hi>Peru,</hi> by the illuſtrious and fortunately bold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, of one of their owne Citizens; a City, whoſe treaſures are much more precious, then all the Riches of the new world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince if perſons bee conſidered according to the Majeſty of their merit, &amp; not what outwardly they onely are, we may boldly ſay, it hath given birth to more Kings, then all the Earth hath Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>I was never very willing to acknowledge my weakneſs, but upon this ſubject, the more I attempt above my ſtrength, the more my obedience, and the deſire I have to ſerve you, is to bee eſteemed; but whither doth my gratitude carry mee? rather then I will loſe the opportunity of giving thanks, I am like to loſe that of obeying you, behold me then prepared for this problem.</p>
               <p>The cruell Homicide having given the fatall blow, flyes, and truly his flying agreed well with the nature of ſuch a Tygre, which certainly was very cruell, ſeeing he had the heart to beſprinkle with gore, a breaſt which intranc'd with delight all that beheld it, a breaſt that could not receive a wound without putting more ſoules, then one, in danger of forſaking their bodies; this Barbarian flies, I would ſay as a cruell Scythian, if it were reaſonable to compare him to a man, Alas! why was not I commanded inſtead of opening anew the wounds of theſe Lovers to expreſs my anger againſt that Caitiffe wretch, whoſe rage aſſaulted that tender beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>Beauty! it is to be adored in what face ſoever one meets it, I pertake ſo ſenſibly in the griefs of theſe poore afflicted, that I ſhould be aſwell pleaſed to revenge their infortunities, as I ſhall think my ſelfe happy, if I have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115194:40"/>to diſtinguiſh the merit of their reſentments, but ſince that is not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; hearken noble Academicks by what reaſon hee pretends to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, who had already his ſword in his hand, and who ſo ſwiftly purſued the cruell and deteſtable Butcher, to eaſe his griefs, by the death of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Murtherer, who deſtroyed and ſet a period to all the felicity hee had ſet all his affections upon; let us die, ſaid that generous Lover, or let us make it appear to her, whom we adore, that our ſouls are all on fire, with rage, to undertake her revenge, by that I would have her know the ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of my love, and that this Age from thence may learne ſhe was my God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and that none, but theſe, that can defend themſelves from a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, ſhall dare to prophane her, whom I adore, and that I am not capable of permitting to be raviſh'd from me, without vengeance, the life of all my hopes, the object of all my deſires, and the onely felicity of my ſoule; how ſhall my Miſtris know that I am worthy the honour to be beloved by her, if inſtead of flying to her revenge, I ſhould ſtay to manifeſt my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by effeminate and feeble teares?</p>
               <p>No, no! to the intent that all the world may ſee <hi>Mars</hi> is never far from <hi>Venus,</hi> I will purſue the Monſter; ſhe will love valour in me, ſince it is the effect of her faire Eyes, and my paſſion; I will demonſtrate, by wounds worthy of my hand, what the wound was I received from thoſe piercing Eyes.</p>
               <p>I never aſſault any, but thoſe that offend mee, and none can offend mee, but in depriving me of my Treaſure, and if you would know what that Treaſure is, enquire of this Evill which is unſufferable, inexpreſſible? hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Fortune hath been ſo little favourable to me, that I had never occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to expreſs my love, but by unprofitable ſighs; but it is unſeaſonable to ſhew either love, or griefe, in the midſt of vengeance, ſince I never had the honour to ſerve her, but after I had loſt her; let us run and ſacrifice this Monſter to the Divinity that he hath prophaned, we ſhall have time enough afterwards to ſigh, and complaine; thoſe who ſlay to lament when they ſhould revenge, deſerve to lament eternally.</p>
               <p>O God! what doe I doe? I ſtay too long to give the blow, whoſe ſole honour conſiſts in being given quickly; let us not walke, let us not run, but flye, if it be poſſible, to repaire our negligence; what? can any heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the vindication of the divinity it adores? delay, alone, will efface the merit of my ſervice, whoſoever loves truly, cannot leave one moment unpuniſhed, that cruell and bloudy minded Monſter, then, if it be true that we love as we ought, let us flye to our vengeance.</p>

               <p>It is thus (O noble Auditors) me thinks that this generous afflicted would ſpeake to juſtifie the cauſe of his fury, and the violence of his proceedings; but whither runneſt thou? whither runneſt thou, crieth that other judicious Lover, conſider that it is more proper firſt, to remedy misfortunes, before we proſecute revenge; whither runneſt thou? whither runneſt thou, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Revenger? if this faire unfortunate cannot be revenged, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being abandoned? leave her revenge to thoſe that deſire her death; ſtay! I prethee, ſtay, this is no teſtimony of thy love, it is of thy fury, this is not the way to repaire our loſſes, it is to multiply them, the more our rage inclines us to vegeance, the more wee ſhall merit in depriving our ſelves of a ſweetneſſe, which, though it gives conſolation for the preſent to our ſoules, hindreth not her deſtruction, and our future loſſe of her for ever.</p>
               <p>Relieve ſo well (if it be poſſible) this dying fair one, that ſhe may live, for to let her dye, to revenge her, is to finiſh, not puniſh the impiety of him that kill'd her: if thou abandon her whom thou haſt ſworne to be the Miſtris of thy ſoule when halfe dead, and languiſhing, ſhe ſo needfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores thine ayde to ſuſtaine, and helpe her; I will never ſay thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd her death, but thou haſt let her dye, that thou mighteſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.</p>
               <p>Oh propenſity too bloudy, unprofitable, arrogant, and cruell honour! if thou haſt left as a prey to death, her, whoſe pale, and languiſhing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo eloquently challenges, that for the laſt proofe of thy fidelity, thou wouldſt give her ſome aſſiſtance; if (I ſay) thou leaveſt her in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, for whoſe ſake wilt thou proſecute revenge? if thou doſt it to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thine owne inclinations, thy love ought not to pretend to the honour of it, for not being able to ſuffer ſo exceſſive a griefe, thou hopeſt, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will give thee ſome eaſe in ſo great a misfortune, whence it plainly appears thou loveſt little, ſeeing thou ſearcheſt for conſolations, when ſhe (whom thou nameſt thy ſoule, lies wounded, and aſſaulted with the mortall agonies of departing pangs) ſighes the laſt disfavours of her fortune, and can I ſpeake it and my heart not breake?) peradventure ſobs out her laſt breath.</p>
               <p>For my part, I had rather pardon that inhumane (who ſhall puniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe abundantly by the conſcience of his owne crime) then faile in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoſe offices of tenderneſs, and affection, which ſhall, it may be, have the power to draw not onely from the grave, but from danger, the onely Beauty I adore; let our Enemy be ſafe, rather then our Miſtris periſh; I will that all my deſires tend to her preſervation, love hath ſo ordered mee,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115194:41"/>that I have nothing in perticular, all my wiſhes, and all my thoughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend abſolutely on her, if ſhe be loſt nothing can ſufficiently repaire mee, for the evills of another cure not mine, and if Heaven, and Deſtiny pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her, I have no need of Remedies; all my wounds will be cured with hers, I have for my onely object the weale of her I love; my paſſion will not give me leave to thinke of mine owne Intereſts, ſo pure is my regard of her, that I wiſh ſhee might yet once more know the quality of my love, whoſe ſole aime is, that ſhee may live, to the end onely, that ſhee may live, rather then for any other ſatisfaction to my ſelfe; it is not that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me to deſire, or aſſiſt the preſervation of her life, and that ſhee would pleaſe to give me leave, to ſtop that pure bloud which iſſues ſo faſt, without the guilty thought of obliging her, but of doing my duty.</p>
               <p>I melt (O noble Auditors) at the laments of this afflicted Lover, that to ſhew to his Mrs. how ardently he deſired her life,-would have continued his complaints, if hee had not been hindred by the care of applying all his thoughts and art to her wounds, and by the need that the fair fainting La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had of repoſe, which required his ſilence.</p>
               <p>But who ſpeaks for the poor miſerable man in a ſwound through his exceſſive grief, and being ſenſible of his own loſs, appears to love himſelfe more then that beauty which he hinders not to dye without either reliefe or revenge? I! I my Lords am moſt propenſe to it, it ſhall bee I, who will take into my protection a griefe which we doe not underſtand, if wee doe not infinitely compaſſionate, and if wee doe not thinke moſt worthy of our pity.</p>
               <p>Oh God! behold at thy feet barbarouſly wounded, and all imbrewed in bloud that boſome of ſnow, which was created for the wonder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of our Eyes, that boſome, the chiefe workmanſhip of Nature, the object of the ſoule, and the cauſe of all thy flame, and the glory of its Age, that divine perſon, as much lovely, as much beloved; what? canſt thou ſee her wounded, languiſh, and dye, without letting thine Eyes lament? thy ſoule, thy heart, and thy life? how cam'ſt thou turn'd to ſuch a Rock, to endure that ſpectacle without diſſolving wholely into teares, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dying with her?</p>
               <p>O gods! behold at my feet thoſe radiant Eys, whoſe ſplendor raviſh'd my ſoule, whoſe glances conſolated my heart, and whoſe regard occaſion'd all my felicity, thoſe Eyes whoſe light gave light to my affections, ſubſiſtance to my hopes, and from whence proceeded all my delights, thoſe inlivening Eyes, thoſe inlivening I ſay, eclipſed, and they themſelves almoſt loſt for want of light, languiſhing, and dying at my feet; canſt thou conſider her

               <p>I loved her onely for her ſelfe, I loved her not becauſe my ſoule deſired ſhe ſhould have been my Love, nor becauſe from her love might proceed all my felicity; if it be not to love well to love thus, teach me in what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion I ſhould love; but if none of you can teach mee otherwiſe, why doe you condemne the feebleneſs of a man, who hath no heart, but as it hath relation to that faire one who was its ſoule, and with whom it is inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?</p>
               <p>O life, of my life! ſoule of my ſoule! if I reliev'd thee not after thy wound, it was becauſe thy wound left me in no condition to relieve thee; the others loved thee by the conſideration of the future, which they hoped would be favourable to their paſſions, and I loved thee by the preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of things; I neither fear'd thy rigour, nor hoped to ſee thee mercifull; thou art what thou art, and I lov'd thee, for nothing, but becauſe I love thee ſtill; my heart neither hopeth, nor feareth, nor reaſoneth, but it loveth in ſuch a manner, that not living but in thee, by thee, and for thee; it is no wonder if it die with thee, or if it revive with thee, and as it is not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to oblige the dead to aſſiſt thee, it is not juſt to puniſh the living, for the impotency of the dead.</p>

               <p>But what do I ſay? is it poſſible, there can bee any Enemies ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to eat our Infants? ſhall I be ſo unfortunate to feare, thou wilt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me leſs, then this bloud-thirſty creature, who is more our Enemy, then our Enemies themſelves? and I (who had rather ſee mine owne childe dye for thy ſervice, then for the preſervation of mine owne life,) ought I to feare I ſhall not have protection from mine owne Prince, whoſe ſubjects this unnaturall woman hath begun already to devoure? I, I ſay believe that the life of the King himſelfe is not aſſured, ſince her owne fleſh, and bloud was not.</p>
               <p>The fierce and barbarous reſolution of this Tygreſs admoniſheth us that we have cauſe to feare all things, for what will ſhee devoure next, now ſhe hath no more children to eat? who can aſſure us, that incited by her hunger, ſhe will not ſell her Countrey for meat? and, to obtaine it of our Enemies, attempt to take away the life of the King himſelfe? if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine continue and paricide eſcape without puniſhment: I know ſhe will accuſe mee of ingratitude, and call mee perfidious, for complaining of a crime which hath nouriſh'd me, but for what reaſon doth ſhee thinke ſhee hath oblig'd? is it for prolonging my life? Alas! I am ſo far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that an obligation, that for but onely ſeeing ſuch a wickedneſs, I ſhall
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115194:45"/>ſigh eternally, and be eternally without comfort; it doth not content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee, O deteſtable one, to have been wicked, unleſs thou injoy the vanity to brag of it, and boaſt that thou haſt alſo made an unfortunate Woman, as wicked as thy ſelfe; there is but one thing can fall out, to make me thinke the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my life a favour, which is (Sir) that I may be ſo happy, to ſee the puniſhment of her ſin, before I dye.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I conſented to her enormous crime, but how could I avoid it? if I had not reſolv'd to take part in the tragick banquet of the body of her childe, my feebleneſs had ſubdued mee, to the neceſſity of ſeeing her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure mine; but there is nothing in the world but the preſervation of the life of a Son, could ever have induc'd me, to have participated in that cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which this Tygreſs calls a favour; the ſame action which was her crime, hath been my puniſhment; was it not thou thy ſelfe that with thine owne hands, tore in pieces thy innocent Babe? did not I turne away mine eyes? had not I horror in eating it? did not I mingle my tears with its bloud? yet that, which I could ſcarcely endure to doe with thy childe, thou wouldſt have me ſuffer with mine owne.</p>
               <p>Oh! neither the juſtice of the King of Heaven, nor Earth will allow this; I ſhould deſerve that my child ſhould be devoured, if I had a ſoule ſo much an Enemy to my Countrey, to give conſent, even with mine owne bloud, to the nouriſhment of a Fury who hath eaten her owne child; I have ſinned, if I may ſay ſo without ſinne, becauſe I ſinned without election, for the ſoule ſinnes not without the will, but I am not excuſable by the ſame reaſon, which ſhe believes capable to excuſe a Paricide; I have a thouſand Reaſons beſides, to juſtifie my innocency.</p>
               <p>Imagine Sir, (if your piety will give you leave to hearken to mee) you ſaw her with a knife in her hand, with a Savage, and bloudy looke, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unmercifully the weeping innocent (whoſe deſtiny was that his very teares haſtened his death) and giving him twenty ſtabs with a poniard, and then to cut his throat, and afterwards tearing out his bowels, breathing, and panting, and at laſt cutting them in pieces, and all this with ſuch dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and quickneſs, that it aſtoniſht me more, then the paricide it ſelfe, and made me thinke ſhee had ſerved an apprenticeſhip in practiſing upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther children, the barbariſme ſhe now exerciſed upon her owne: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! how ſhall I make an end? ſhe ſpitted it, ſhe blew the fire, and baſted the little body, ſhe complaind of nothing, but that the fire was too ſlow to roſt her ſon: O Tygreſs! O Fury! O wicked Demon!</p>
               <p>But Sir, I perceive this horrible Relation doth ſo much aſtoniſh you, that it takes away your power, not onely of judging, but of hearing me, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115194:45"/>indeed who would not have the ſame reſentment? Now Sir, if you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without having ſeen this cruell ſpectacle, but in my deſcription, you that are a Man, a Souldier, and a King, you that are out of danger, judge then of my condition in the midſt of that horror? I who am a Woman, weakened with famine, and danger of my childe between life, and death; in this extaſie, I had nor time, nor meanes, nor ſtrength to know what I did, I eate I know not what, for my ſoule wholly intentive, to ſave my owne Infant, had no leaſure to think of that of anothers.</p>
               <p>Behold that ſhe Caniball, who devours the ſubjects of her Prince, the Souldiers of the Kingdome, and the Defenders of our Countrey; puniſh, O puniſh this ravenous devourer of our Citizens, who hath taught to others, that the fleſh of her owne is nouriſhing, and who hath incenſed the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens when they have moſt need of appeaſing: it troubleth me, there ſhould be no other way to puniſh her but by that death that I ſhould have thought a happineſs before ſhe made me ſinne, if I could have been aſſured her rage would have ſpared my childe; I ſay well in ſaying her rage, for I ſhould lie, if I ſhould ſay; it was onely her hunger, for, a woman, who had ſtrength to fright a Mother, and to engage her to the neceſſity, of defending the life of her childe, was not reduc'd to the laſt extremity of hunger, ſhe was too quick, too fierce, and too menacing; for a woman, whom famine had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly enfeebled, and if ſhe deny her fury and her force, the great blows ſhe gave to her owne ſon will evidence it, they could not proceed from an arme decayed, from an arme of a Woman, and from an arme of a Mother enfeebled by long famine.</p>
               <p>Chaſtiſe this malefactor, ſtifle this pernicious example, revenge the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done to the Hebrew name, in puniſhing her crime, that we may ſhew to after Ages, wee abhorr'd it: our Nation will bee more deteſted for her paricide, then it was glorious for the victories of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſhe alone, ſhall darken the honour of ſo memorable a Siege, and ſo nobly maintained.</p>
               <p>On then brave Prince! on then Father! on then Sir, cut off this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted member, for feare it corrupts the whole body; teare up, by the roots, this contagious branch, whoſe very ſhaddow is dangerous: what doe you ſtay for? you already know her inclinations, her owne ſon being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, ſhee intends to devoure thoſe of others; and that ſhee is yet more dangerous, ſhe pretends to doe it by juſtice, ſo ill an opinion hath ſhe of the equity of her Judge; it is againſt thy intereſt (O great King) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this poore Innocent to the rage of this inſatiable Woolfe, it will bee quickly devoured, it is too little to laſt long, and ſhe too ravenous to make
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115194:46"/>more, then one meale of it; with what ſhall we aſſwage the hunger of this monſter accuſtomed to eat the fleſh of children? as for thoſe that have none, they are not concern'd in my intereſt, but they that have, let them conſider that the enemy threatneth to make them ſlaves, and ſhe to devour them, if the juſtice of him, who is above juſtice, doth not protect them; let us goe and offer our Children to the ſword of our Enemies, I ſay our Children, becauſe the Children, of our Enemies, pleaſe not this impious wretch, will you then expect another proofe then this very inſtance of her wickedneſs, if neceſſity conſtraine her, ought ſhe not rather to eat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Children then ours? doe not your valiant ſwords kill enough by ſo many brave ſallies to ſatisfie the hunger of this ravenous devourer of fleſh?</p>
               <p>Goe on then mercifull Prince! goe on then Protector of Innocents! preſerve thy Kingdome from the greateſt infection it can have, beſides the wrath of the Almighty, for canſt thou believe that God will deliver from ſo dangerous a ſiege, a City, wherein Paricide paſſeth unpuniſhed? I would ſpeake more, but I dare not for feare leſt in the mean time the abſolute, and laſt neceſſities of hunger ſeizing upon this unnaturall, it ſhould not lie in the power of the King to ſave my Childe from her ravenous fury; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I feele already feebleneſs oppreſs me, which is an infallible ſigne of my innocence, I have eaten ſo little of the Child of another, that my weakneſs conſtrains me ſo ſuddenly to leave the defence of mine owne, from whence you may judge whether I did it by force, or inclination: but I die, and yet there is left too much to ſay; the death of this unfortunate is not the cauſe of my teares; for it brought mortality with it into the world, the Warre, Fortune and Famine have reduc'd me to ſuch a degree of calamity, that I weep it rather as dead, then about to die, neither are theſe agitations new to me, I grieve that my ſon, my ſoule, my bowels ſhould be forc'd to ſerve for nouriſhment to a Monſter, who hath diſhonoured my Countrey, and would make it deſolate.</p>
               <p>Griefe ſtifles me, and takes away my voice, I can ſay no more, I dye, behold this miſerable poore unfortunate Babe! what crime hath it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIR, It is a Woman which ſpeaks, it may be it ſeems ſtrange that I tell thee I am a Woman, for by the ſtate of body, in which I appear, I may feare thou believeſt me a ſhaddow, and I know they have deſcrib'd me to thee, as a wild Beaſt, but I give thanks to Heaven, which hath brought me before a King, whoſe profound Judgement cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; behold then here a Woman ſo miſerable that ſhe hath been forc'd, even to the eating of her owne Children, and yet ſo perſecuted, that ſhe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of monſirous impiety; when ſhe comes to demand juſtice, ſhe whoſe life I have preſerv'd with mine owne bowels, ſtrives to procure my death, I find my ſelfe accus'd by one, from whom I expected not only thanks, but recompence.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity which hath forc'd me to eate mine owne Child, begins to be the leaſt of my evils; Alas! who will pity me? or rather who will not pity me? I demand Juſtice (pardon me great Sir, if I am not upon my knees, weakneſs, and not irreverence is the cauſe, I ſhall fall if I ſtoop) and ſince I ought not endeavour, by a feigned humility, to ſurprize a Judge, whoſe wiſe, and apprehenſive ſoule cannot be deluded by outward ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; you will therefore pardon the omiſſion of Ceremony.</p>
               <p>Unhappy I! if amongſt my other infelicities, I had met with a Judge of a common capacity, or a Prince of a vulgar ſoule, one that would have been captivated, and charmed with flattery, and one that the very appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of crime is able to diſcompoſe, unhappy were I! I ſay, if I had met with ſuch a one, an ordinary apprehenſion had at the very name of Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, condemned this unfortunate, without conſidering the quality of the fact, or the cauſe that compell'd me to commit it; but thoſe are ſlight, ſhallow, or effeminate men, without bottome, without courage, and not onely unworthy to command Kingdomes, and pretend to triumphs; but of ſoules ſo undiſcerning, that the bare names, without circumſtances of crimes, fright them: we ought to conſider reallities, and not appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>And now to have met with a Prince, of ſo magnanimous courage, who with onely one City, and that hunger-ſtarv'd, dares yet promiſe himſelfe the Victory over a great Kingdome, that bandies it ſelfe againſt him; is not this, is not this a bleſſing over-ballancing all my other infelicities? but I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115194:47"/>eſteem my cauſe ſuch, that I believe it needs no other eloquence, then its owne equity; expect not Sir, that I dreſſe up my diſtreſſes, nor that I ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate my ſufferings, I invoke not the Heavens, I envy not againſt my accuſer, innocent cauſes have no need of ſuch gilding artifice; for my part, in recounting to thee nakedly my buſines by the teſtimony of my very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I wil make it evident to thee, that I am ſo innocent, that ſhe her ſelf ſhal confeſs that all, that ſhe had patch'd up together, when ſhe complain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, amounted to nothing, becauſe ſhe hath proved nothing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an equall Judge takes impreſſion of nothing, but the fact only, when he perceives that the paſſion and intereſt of thoſe whoſe ſubtilty would diſguiſe truth, and ſeduce his judgement by deceitfull inductions, which often hurry Judges into a precipice of errour, and unjuſt ſentence.</p>
               <p>And thou my fierce, and ingratefull Enemy, who accuſeſt me with ſo much injuſtice, art thou contented to appeale to thy ſelfe? for though thy conſent be not materiall, and thou being accuſtomed ſo little, to obſerve actions done by thy ſelfe, wilt thou that thy owne depoſitions ſhall be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid? I feele my ſelfe ſo caſt downe with hunger, that if they permit thee to reply, and that they oblige me to tedious formalities, it is certaine that the ſentence will be on thy ſide, if the judge will not, Famine will caſt me into my grave, before the end of this ſad proceſs.</p>
               <p>What? doſt thou deſire that I confeſs my fault? if that be it, thou haſt ſaid nothing that I am not ready to affirme: <hi>in fine,</hi> what doſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve? ſhe is ſilent, that is to ſay, without ſpeaking, ſhe acknowledgeth her fault, and is undoubtedly ready to diſcharge her conſcience, and it may be my unhappy childe (dead as it is) in the boſome of this cruell wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, fights in favour of his Mother.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſhe ſaith, that <hi>conſtrained by hunger ſhee aſcended my ſtaires with her Infant:</hi> ſhe ſaith, <hi>that I received her with I know not what of horrible in my countenance, and with a motion too ſtrong for the weakeneſſe I was in, and that praiſing the good plight of her childe, I gave her cauſe to tremble at the unſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that innocent,</hi> is it not true Sir? I ſubſcribe to all ſhe hath ſaid; <hi>in fine,</hi> God protects innocence? our Enemies themſelves witneſſe in favour of mine: See Sir, what I was! I was ſo hunger-ſtarv'd, that the extremity of Famine, had transform'd me, to be as a wild beaſt; I was become ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that I was even ſuch to my friend, ſhe here found me in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that ſhe believ'd me capable of eating her childe, and yet, in this dreadfull eſtate I ſtayed at home, and expected peaceably my death every moment.</p>

               <p>Deare Auditors, are you not touch'd with pity? <hi>I received her with a motion too precipitate,</hi> ungrate and barbarous as ſhe is! in this condition which was ſo horrible.

               <p>In that she will lie, you ought not to marvell if she waver in her words, and if she ſay I render'd it unto her willingly, my innocence appears, ſeeing in my laſt extremity, I was juſt in returning back a thing more valuable to me, then all the treaſure of the Univerſe, ſince it might have ſaved my life; but amongſt theſe diſputes violences, and feares, my ſoule, agitated with a thouſand various paſſions began to feele evils yet more horrid, and my hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was ſo ſtrongly augmented by that object, that to give back a child, and a child which was none of mine owne, and a child in ſo good plight, was to haſten my death, and yet I did it; but Nature having loſt the remembrance of all other obligations, ſave that of preſerving it ſelfe, began to ſuggeſt the means as ſtrange, as profitable; let them eat what they may, ſaid I, ſince neceſſity hinders from eating what they ought.</p>
               <p>What do we do? in vain we offer vowes to Fortune, to ſend us Rats or Dogs, for of all Victuall heretofore horrible (but now worthy of Envy) there is no more in my houſe unleſs in my intrals digeſted; I do not ſay in my flesh, for if I had found one ounce in any part of my body &amp; God he knows whether I ſought with care, or not, my heart had never been capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſent to that paricidall thought, of feeding upon the flesh of my child, that is to ſay, my heart, my life, and my ſoule, no not in this point, where neceſſity is pronounced invincible, and all things are permitted but delay, if I had found but one morſell of my owne fleſh left, I had never thought (I ſay) of feeding upon my owne child.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I do? (ſaid I) and, being deſperate, I turned towards this woman, and ſpake to her thus; but great Prince recall into your memory the words that she hath uttered to you, which are theſe, for I would not, in ſpeaking in my defence, alter, ſweeten, or forget the leaſt thing: be you your ſelfe therefore pleaſed to repeat the words of my accuſer, <hi>the laſt thing

I know that she will ſay, that whatever her crime is, she never intended the death of her child, but being reſolved to deceive me, and only conſpiring againſt the life of mine, she pretends her affrightment for her excuſe, and perceives not that little pollicy, which yet abſolves her not from paricide, adds the crime to her, of being deceitfull to her friend, and impious to Heaven; for in agreeing to our conditions, she invok'd the name of God, which, in this caſe as it is conſpicuous before you, muſt needs be judg'd a crying ſin, barely to mingle the ſacred name of the moſt high.</p>
               <p>Yet had she the boldneſs to call, to countenance her wicked deceit, that Almighty power which she invok'd without either believing in him, or trembling to offend him, if it be true she believes in God? Conſider by the truth of her intention, you heere preſent who have heard what her faith was; if this woman who was not inforc'd by the extremity of her hunger, to the neceſſity of ſuch an action, had oppos'd me, and repreſented unto me the horror of the fact, I ſhou'd undoubtedly have abſtained, and after the knowledge of it, should have dyed a thouſand times, rather then have kild a ſon; indeed why should I have asked counſel if I had not fear'd the neceſſities of the body, might have extinguished the light of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?</p>
               <p>If the onely deſigne of nourishing me, had carried me to that reſolution, what need had I of her? had not I a childe as well as she? and in what have I bettered my condition in dividing with her? did she not receive the ſame

                  <hi>Let us begin</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>with mine, I am content, provided thine may have the ſame fate, for I would not have it enter into thy thoughts, that I have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to deceive thee:</hi> Behold my Lords! that to ſave the life of a childe, I would not deceive, and that I knew how to bee juſt even in killing; I should never have thought of ſo horrible a ſuſtenance, whileſt I had ſtrength or hope to finde any reliefe any other way, but when neceſſity, which is alwaies invincible, had reduc'd me to the laſt extremity, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of ſo long a ſiege had left nothing for man, but man, and that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine having overcome all other things, had at laſt overcome Nature, and conſtancy, it was abſolutely unavoydable for me to reſolve, yet I did it not without conſulting of the thing, and finding it inevitable, to what should I have addreſs'd me? it may be you will ſay rather to the children of others; no Sir, I addreſs'd me to mine owne.</p>
               <p>But tell me in pitty Sir, in an exigent ſo important, in mine owne houſe, and having in mine armes the fat child of another, was not I very juſt, in that I began not with the death of hers? O God! is there a heart ſo hard, not to have compaſſion on mine affliction? that being enforc'd to eate a child, or famish, when I had in my armes the child of another, I began with mine owne; all Fathers are oblig'd to this Example for the lives of theirs.</p>
               <p>Ah! If there be a heart to be found capable of wishing me ill, it deſerves to feele a griefe ſuitable to mine, that to ſtaine Nature, they be conſtrained to act againſt Nature: I know that this frightfull name of paricide, dazles weake ſoules, and raiſes me many Enemies, but I know withall, that this weakneſs is not a weakneſs of Kings, but of vulgar, and unknowing men; thoſe Lawes which have permitted Fathers to kill their children, for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would they forbid them to kill them for neceſſity, to which all things ſubmit?</p>
               <p>If I had kill'd my ſon for ſome unnaturall outrage, done againſt his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would have eſteemed me innocent, now having kill'd him by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable conſtraint, they believe me guilty; but great Prince, who was he at the beginning of the Siege, made us pull downe, and burn ſo many mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Pallaces, contiguous to the very walls of our City, and ſuch Pallaces
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115194:50"/>as were worth halfe a Kingdome, and tooke up little leſſe roome? was it not thou mighty Prince? and why that cruelty, common Father of the Countrey, to thy ſubjects, and to thy children? what could they feare worſe from the Enemy? me thinkes I heare every one anſwer mee, that it was to aſſure the City, and to prevent harborage to the Enemy, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to perpetrate this mercileſs cruelty; it is then true, that the deſigne and end propos'd, is that which juſtifies, or condemnes the action; how many Provinces, and how many Armies by the command of their Kings, and of their Generals have willingly expos'd themſelves to extreame loſſes, to prevent eminent evils? then if it be a remedy ancient, and approved, that in extreame neceſſities, men devoure men? what ſtar, or what fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny excludes me from the common priviledges of humane kinde? perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it may be for that I am a woman, my reſolution did not ſuit with my ſex; it may be, becauſe I am a Mother: why? is the deſire of living leſs naturall to the Mother, then to the Son?</p>
               <p>We never condemne that inſtinct, which, for the neceſſity of life, makes the Infant draw every day the moſt pure bloud from the boſome of his Mother; and may not the poore Mother, incited for preſervation of her life, and by compulſion of Nature lawfully by the right ſhe hath over her Childe, make uſe of her owne bloud, and of her owne bowels?</p>
               <p>I know as well as another, that there is none ſo cruell, but hath compaſſion for the murther of a yong Infant, whoſe innocence is ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pity, but who might be killed with ſo little loſs to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as this yong child? and by what other Reaſon ſhould a Mother that hath loſt her Son, have been ever comforted, if there had not remained that feeble conſolation of ſeeing it die at the leaſt innocent? me thinks all heere preſent ſay, that ſhe who accuſeth me would have endeavoured to have had a child of the Enemies, O abominable wickedneſs! O execrable thought! God deliver me from an attaint ſo impious, no not to redeem my ſelfe from my grave, I could not goe, and ſearch for the Infants of others, unleſs I had had a deſigne to eat children, before I was conſtrained by the extreame neceſſity of the ſiege; O God deliver me from purpoſes ſo impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſuch as could never be hatch'd in the thoughts of her who is ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, that ſhee never thought of eating humane fleſh, before ſhe found it abſolutely impoſſible, to defer one moment the eating of her owne ſon!</p>
               <p>Thus from the very ſame things of which thou accuſeſt me; I pretend to derive my honour; expect not great Prince, that I ſhould intreat thee, or conjure thee to exterminate this ungratefull Creature, who inſtead of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving religiouſly conditions with her that preſerved her life at ſo deare a rate,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115194:49"/>endeavouts by an impudence without example, to take that from me, which I value more then my life, my reputation, ſhe would make an impreſſion in thy judgement, O King, that I am wicked, and that I am unjuſt: No, no Sir, I thinke not of it, for not having committed a crime to preſerve my life, I will not to purſue my revenge.</p>
               <p>Be thou then judge what is to be done, thou whoſe prudence in all times, and in all places, and in all things knowes ſo clearly to diſtinguiſh equity from iniquity, and innocence from guilt, whether ſhe did eat of my ſonnes fleſh for cruelty or neceſſity? ask her, herſelfe, whether a woman ſo enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by famine, could go rambling abroad to ſeek for reliefe, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether it be likely ſhe was in that extremity that being in an affright for the danger of her ſon, ſhe had yet ſtrength enough to teare it from the boſome of that Fury who devour'd it with her eyes; yes, demand of her, herſelfe, if ſhe be impudent enough to maintaine that hunger had rendred her feeble, and languiſhing?</p>
               <p>After ſhe hath confeſs'd her ſon to be fat, and thriving, demand of her (I ſay) whether a Woman in the condition ſhe hath depainted her ſelfe, could have milke enough to preſerve him in ſuch well-liking; this pretended foundation being demoliſhed, where was that neceſſity? ſuch a neceſſity as in my caſe hath beene evinced by the teſtimony of my fierceſt Enemy, I know not, but I believe you ſee the Rampiers, whereby ſhe believed her impiety aſſured, to faile and fall; what wilt thou doe Sir? wilt thou ſuffer a woman ſo impious, ſo barbarous, ſo deteſtable, to live under thy protection?</p>
               <p>Great Prince, what doſt thou reſolve? for my part. I make no ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be revenged, though this Monſter ſhames not onely her Countrey, but the whole Age; if ſhe fall, I would rather have it to be meerly by thy juſtice, then by my ſolicitation; yes, let her outrage to me be pardoned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it wound not thy Juſtice, neither doe I demand the murther of her child, but I demand ſomething, even any thing, to ſuſtaine my life, which is even now expiring, if I have not preſently ſome food to relieve me; if ſhe hath any other thing for my nourishment, and to diſ-ingage her from the conditions to which she is obliged, it shall ſatisfie, whatever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That every one have what belongs to him, is a Rule thought to bee moſt juſt in all Kingdomes, and eſpecially heere where the King is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115194:49"/>ſo juſt, that rather then to abandon him, his ſubjects reſolve to eat their owne children.</p>
               <p>Well, what is there more expected? the Examination is had, ſhe hath confeſs'd, and I demand immediate ſentence; for by this little delay thou O King! wilt be guilty of my death: the moſt cruell hangman that the wickedneſs of this woman can feare, is that which I feele in my intrals; Sir, Hunger tears me, if thou forbeare to do me juſtice, becauſe this kinde of juſtice carrieth with it I know not what, of prodigious, it is to do an injury to thy Kingly Office, which ordaines thee to doe as thou oughtſt, though it overthrow the whole World.</p>
               <p>That which I demand is a life; but it is true, a life unprofitable, a life full of miſery, alife that I have purchaſed with mine owne childes life; to be mercifull to a childe, wilt thou be cruell to a Mother, who deſires to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her child onely for thy ſervice, and that doth not finde life ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for love of it, but that it may bee uſefull for thy ſervice? indeed for whom could I have prolonged a life, which Widdow-hood, and the loſſe of a childe, old Age and Famine, makes a living Hell, if it had not beene to ſerve thee with that little ſtrength which remaines to carry earth to fill the Bulworkes, and Hot-water to the Souldiers to defend the liberty; the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the life of my King?</p>
               <p>Reſolve then wiſe Prince, reſolve (I ſay) then deare Maſter; what doſt thou expect, that I alſo periſh to become food for this wicked Woman, whom I could not oblige by giving her, her life? it is leſs dangerous to doe her injury, then favours, I have preſerved her, and ſhe would deſtroy me, if thou doſt preſerve her; ſhe will certainly be miſchievous alſo to thee; of this truth I am a ſad example, ſeeing I have torne out mine owne bowels to feed her, ſhe brings it to a queſtion, whether that which I have bought, and payd for, be mine owne; r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115194:52"/>and Ladies, ſome having maintain'd, that a Maſque was onely fit for ill-favoured faces; others as confidently affirming, that Beauty, as the more dangerous thing, was onely fit to be maſqu'd: in this diverſity of opinions,</hi> Manzine <hi>declares his, after this manner.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have not ſo advantagious an opinion of my ſelfe (moſt illuſtrious Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) as to believe I have a liberty allowed me to hold an opinion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your judgement; that judgement I meane, which was pleas'd to think me capable of an enterpriſe, which I thought far above my ſtrength; 'tis a thing nevertheleſs not a little ſtrange, that a perſon bred under the ſhade of night, ſhould be put to diſcourſe of beauty, that is a bright Sun; and that thoſe eyes ſhould be choſen to judge of deformity, which have been accuſtom'd to abide the moſt lively, and penetrating beames of this beauty.</p>
               <p>And thence it comes to paſs, that in ſpite of my endeavours, my ſenſe gets the Maſtry of my underſtanding, offering to my imagination what traverſes a miſerable weak Cock-boat may juſtly apprehend, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to ſtruggle againſt the large waves of the vaſt Ocean. But hap what will, by his authority, who hath commanded me, I am ingag'd in the main Sea; &amp; thoſe ſtars (which upon another occaſion I ſhould cal ſuns) make me hope for a ſafe harbour, and give me aſſurance, that their favourable beams ſeconding the Art of the Pilot, will bring me ſafe to ſhore.</p>
               <p>And although that lively Alabaſter, which ſparkles round about me, like the beating of the Sea threatens me with quick-ſands, I ſhall nevertheleſs eſteem that ſhiprack happy where the waves are of milke, and the field is ſo faire, as 'twould prove an honour to procure a grove in it.</p>
               <p>But to loſe no time, which of it ſelfe runs ſo faſt, away, with which part of the diſpute ought I to begin my diſcourſe? The queſtion propoſed is, whether a Maſque do more properly belong to a handſom, or an ill-favour'd face?</p>
               <p>I know that thoſe who conſider things but ſlightly by the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, will conclude, that a Maſque infallibly belongs to the worſt face; that they will believe, 'twas invented only to ſecure ill faces from the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mens eyes might doe them; ſo that they will be ready to ſay, that no ſhape in the world can derive ſo much advantage by being hid as deformity, which, buried under a Maſque, is not onely protected from injuries, and contempt, but which is more, under that favourable ſhadow ſhe marches upon ſuch equall tearms with Beauty, that the viſage of <hi>Hocuba</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:115194:53"/>are the ſame thing, whilſt they both continue ſo covered. This happy Miſque addes ſo much to an ill-favour'd face, that it not onely hides an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that diſpleaſes the eye, corrects a default in Nature, and rectifies a ſin of the Times, but beſides, places it in the ſame condition with Beauties, and makes it equall with that which hath beene ador'd even by the Heathen gods.</p>
               <p>All this is well, (may ſome one ſay) but if we hide our uglineſs, what ſhall put us in minde, that the defects of the body ought to be repair'd by the excellency of the ſoule. <hi>Socrates</hi> exhorted youth to view their faces in a glaſs, that thoſe that were ill-favour'd might endeavour to mend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe that had beauty might take care not to deforme it by the imperfections of Vice.</p>
               <p>And indeed when a noble ſoule ſhall perceive it ſelfe impriſon'd in an unhandſome and contemptible body, the more will it endeavour to make it ſelfe viſible to become worthy of eſteem: For my part I have alwayes look'd upon unhandſomneſs as a very conſiderable gift of Heaven, and a deep deſigne of the Divinity; for having reſolve to impart to the world one beame of its owne brightneſs in humane beauty, made uſe of deformity as her oppoſite, that the eye by comparing contraries, might fully, and entirely diſcover the excellence of beauty.</p>
               <p>And is't not evident, that if all Women were handſome, beauty would grow ſo common, that no man would admire it; and that 'twould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have any ſtrong deſires for ſo ordinary a thing? Amongſt the greateſt advantages which belong to Beauty, one of the moſt conſiderable is, that it ſerves the minde as a light, to guide and help it to aſcend to the knowledge of the intelligible world.</p>
               <p>But to demonſtrate how much more deformity contributes to that then beauty; it will ſuffice to compare them together: What Lover is there, whoſe judgment is not diſtracted, and that, in his Idolatry does not believe, that nothing but what he adores can juſtly pretend to the title of beauty? what Lover can be found, which calls not that his Sun, which is his fire; which invocates not her, as his tutelary Angel, who in concluſion proves his evill ſpirit? and looks not upon that houſe as a Heaven, or a Temple, which preſerves his Goddeſs from the injuries of men, and weather? O miſerable Deity! whoſe divinity hath need of humane help? that were indeed to tie the ſoule to earth, and not to lift it up to heaven. But as the ſhaddow makes the light appeare the clearer, and cold weather makes the Sun-beames the more welcome: even ſo deformity not at all furniſhed with any thing that might delight the ſoule, does put the minde into ſuch a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115194:53"/>loathing of all theſe fraile and tranſitory vanities of the world, that raiſing it to the contemplation and knowledge of the onely true happineſs, it is forc'd to reſolve to quit theſe periſhable beauties, and wholly to fix it ſelfe upon him, who onely is perfect and deſirable: ſo then uglineſs is a gift of Heaven, and by ſo much more precious then beauty, as 'tis leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the injuries of time, from whoſe ſeverity it apprehends not the leaſt danger of being made worſe.</p>
               <p>Unhandſomneſs, the ſure and infallible guide of the minde; the certaine marke of Divinity, ſhall that be covered under a darke Vaile, or impriſon'd, and buried under a troubleſome cloud? and what ſhall then become of that unchaſte veſtall beauty, that does ſo much miſchiefe, if ſhe that is the very quinteſſence of chaſtity muſt be buried amongſt the living? ſhe that is a Virgin ſo pure, and unſpotted? 'twill be as great an injury to Vertue, as ill-favour'dneſs, if ſhe be contemn'd, for thereby we declare that even Vertue her ſelfe is not every where amiable: as if the Sun were onely ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative upon the pureſt matter, and Jewels deriv'd their value from the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, wherein they are inclos'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olympia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Philip</hi> was much in the right, when ſhe told a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who had made choice of a handſome, but unchaſte Miſtris, that 'twas not fit to chooſe a Wife, onely, by the outſide; and indeed, what more is beauty (for whoſe ſake we would bury the precious treaſure of deformity) but a ſingle ſtroake of Natures Penſill? a Cheat of the times, a good thing that flies away, a glorious Sunne that ſoone ſets, a poſſeſſion that's alwayes troubleſome, becauſe ever envied, kept with too great ſubjection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd with too much Idolatry? If ſhe be pitifull, ſhe's diſhoneſt, cruell, if ſhe reſiſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude, an ingenious ſoule muſt needs ſay of outward handſomneſs, as <hi>Liſander</hi> ſpake of certaine fine gowns, that were ſent him for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I will not have theſe fine cloathes make my daughters ſeem leſs hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: From theſe Reaſons oppos'd to the former, the reſult will be, that this Tomb of the face (if you will give me leave to give a Maſque that name) is more proper for nothing, then Beauty; and I very well perceive by ſome languiſhing eyes, that I ſee about me, that more then one in this company could wiſh, that this dangerous thing call'd Beauty had never walk'd but in her Maſque.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that the famous Painter <hi>Thimantes,</hi> had done ſacrifice to the god of Counſell, when having made a Picture of <hi>Venus</hi> excellently handſome in all the parts of her body, he drew a Veile over her face; not as the weaker ſort believ'd, becauſe he deſpair'd of finiſhing what he had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115194:54"/>begun, with the like perfection; but that this diſcreet Painter knew, that her beauty was ſo great, that had he given it the laſt degree of perfection, ſhe muſt have prov'd as dangerous, to the ſoule, as pleaſing to the Eye; and thereby taught us, that 'tis no leſs prudence to hide beauty, then to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a great fire.</p>
               <p>And this was <hi>Alexanders</hi> opinion, when, having taken the Wife and Daughters of <hi>Darius</hi> priſoners, he declar'd that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Beauties were very hurtfull to the Eye-ſight. <hi>Lucian,</hi> who deteſted beauty, call'd it the Enemy of Nature, by whom man being created free and couragious, was (like a poore ſlave) reduc'd to ſerve that Idoll with more ſatisfaction, then he was capable of receiving by the command of the whole world. Let us then cover this Inchantreſs, which ſeduces our Reaſon, and ſo blindes the eyes of our underſtanding, that 'tis not able to diſtinguiſh thoſe objects, which deſerve to be contemn'd, from ſuch as merit adoration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phidias,</hi> who painted <hi>Venus</hi> upon a Torteys, (to teach the Grecian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 'twas fit to ſhut up Beauty in a houſe) would never have put himſelfe to that trouble, had he knowne the uſe of a Maſque; which is onely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preſerve chaſtity, to keep mens hearts at liberty; to defend beauty from violence, and ſecure the eyes from treachery, and deceit.</p>
               <p>I confeſs 'tis true, ſhould we maſque Beauty, we ſhould be depriv'd of ſome kinde of ſweetneſs, which this pleaſing Witch ſuffers us to taſte: But whilſt we receive this wound, 'tis like that Enemy of <hi>Prometheus</hi> the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalian,</hi> who cur'd him with a wound: happy <hi>Prometheus,</hi> whoſe very wounds prove his good Fortune.</p>
               <p>Hide then, O hide this Beauty which is ſo criminall, that having more of Heaven in it then any other thing, is by ſo much the more guilty for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo ungratefully abus'd thoſe great advantages: Hide that thing which imperfect, that it can never give a man intire ſatisfaction, whoſe poyſon is very like that of the Serpent, which the Naturalliſts mention, which when a man hath once taken, the more hee drinkes, the more hee ſhall thirſt.</p>
               <p>But if the effects of this Beauty bee ſuch as theſe, let every one conſult with his owne heart, and not truſt his eyes, which are but like fooliſh Gnats dazeled with the leaſt glimmering; who to enjoy the brightneſs of the light, feare not to periſh in the heat of the flame.

               <p>Hide, O hide this perfidious flattereſs, this proud vanity, which triumphs over the world, this unſeperable companion of pride, this impudent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of unchaſte deſires; whoſe triumph is the aſhes of thoſe that run after her, whoſe Trophees are diſtracted ſoules; in whoſe Temples we onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to vanity, and her oracles are onely given to make us. Let us bury this ruine of the Univerſe, and at length revenge ſo many Provinces made deſolate, and quite brought to nothing for her, or rather by her: Let the famous City of <hi>Troy</hi> tell you, what ſhe can doe, that <hi>Troy,</hi> whereof there are not now the leaſt footſteps extant, but in mens memories; though 'twas formerly the wonder of all the Earth.</p>
               <p>But if any too paſſionate Lover ſhould perſiſt, and tell me, it cannot bee fit to cloud Beauty under a Maſque, ſince it is the delight of the eyes, and the choiſeſt piece of Natures worman-ſhip; I ſhall bee forc'd to anſwer him, that for that very reaſon, it ought to be hid, becauſe ſo precious a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well cannot bee too carefully preſerv'd.</p>
               <p>How often hath the lovely Roſe growing upon its owne ſtock (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon its Throne of beauty) forc'd the hand of the Beholder to doe it a mortall outrage? how often hath the falling Lilly in perfum'd tears bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her beauty, which periſh'd onely by being too much ſhowne? <hi>In fine,</hi> a Maſque is ſo proper for beauty, that, no doubt, ſhe her ſelfe found out the invention: She found ſhe was a fire dangerous to the heart; a treaſure too much expos'd to the deſires of ſuch as endeavour'd to enjoy her; ſo that at length wearied with ſo many ſighes, and complaints; and reſolv'd to free her ſelfe from the importunity of her Lovers; reſolv'd to be deliver'd from the ſlavery of a Looking-glaſs, that mercinary Councellour, which, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of her flatteries, takes away from the Ladies above halfe the time of their lives; reſolv'd to ſet her ſelfe at liberty from the troubleſome ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to pride, and vanity, the inſeperable companions of her Majeſty; ſhe devis'd this covering for her face, or rather this Buckler for her chaſtity, that, hiding her beauty, which is the ſeed of Love, ſhe might ſecure her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, the chiefe ornament of a vertuous and well-born ſoule.</p>
               <p>Who ſhall then for ever hereafter diſpute Beauties title to the Maſque? No, no! it muſt be yielded her, and if we will not have her hid, becauſe ſhe is innocent, let her be cover'd becauſe ſhe deſerves it, as being divine. Sacred things are cover'd to ſtir up our reverence; Majeſty, leſt it ſhould grow common; Beauty to prevent ſatiety; all to make themſelves deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>But, me thinks I heare ſome impatient man complaining, that I am ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the funeralls of Beauty; and, that, burying her under a Maſque, I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115194:55"/>leave the world in ſuch a miſerable condition, that their eyes are of no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe: for to what purpoſe ſhould wee open thoſe uſeleſs doores of the underſtanding, if beauty be hid, which is the rare, and onely object of the heart, the delight of the ſoule, the light of the minde, and the greateſt grace that ever was ſent from Heaven to the Earth?</p>
               <p>But this angry man is miſtaken, who without knowing my meaning, reproves me too ſharply, whoſe whole ſtudy, and all the actions both of my body, and ſoule, have never had other object then beauty, of which I am and ever ſhall be an Adorer: My eyes ſerve me to no other purpoſe, but to behold her; my mouth opens not, but to praiſe her; I walk not, but to do her ſervice; nor ſtand ſtill, but to admire her; I ſleep not, but to dreame of her; nor wake, but to ſee her againe; and in a word, I kneele not, but to adore her, as the pureſt beam of the Divinity, which gently conducting the minde to its originall, forces it, in the midſt of earthly things to reverence the heavenly.</p>
               <p>Shall I, that hold from this Beauty the ſmall merit my ſoule can pretend to, which guided, and enlightned by her hath often attempted, if not with great ſucceſs, at leaſt with great deſire to attaine to the higheſt degrees of Vertue? Shall I bury mine owne glory, and frame that darkneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my eyes of the ſight of that brightneſs, which they ſo highly delight in? And can you believe I ſhould have been made choice of amongſt ſo many eminent wits, to ſpeak out of this Chair, or rather this Capitol, where ſo many great men have triumph'd, if I had not within me inclination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the matter I am to treat of?</p>
               <p>We reſolv'd to treat (as you have heard) of the high perfections of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and becauſe he beſt deſerves to ſpeake of beauty (not that hath moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, but) that hath moſt affection for her, I was advanc'd to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being heard in ſuch a place, where 'tis a favour to be admitted as an Auditor.</p>
               <p>Then judge if I, who am indebted to Beauty for ſo many favours, and have ſo many ſeverall wayes had experience of her power, can ever indeavour to obſcure this Sunne-ſhine, or indeavour to impriſon her, which, like fire, burnes with the more violence, when 'tis reſtrain'd. I am not ſo ignorant, like <hi>Aeſops</hi> Cock to undervalue jewels; nor ſo ill advis'd to attempt the death of that beauty, who, being heretofore injured in words only, deſerv'd ſo well, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe reveng'd her quarrel: <hi>Steſicores</hi> is a ſufficient teſtimony of this, who having by his ill-language endeavour'd to obſcure <hi>Helens</hi> beauty, was ſtricken blinde; 'tis true, that when he had ſhewne his repentance, by advancing her praiſes, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115194:55"/>he had injur'd, the gods reſtor'd him to his ſight, thereby leaving us an aſſurance, that Nature hath nothing more worthy of reſpect, nothing more precious, nothing more divine in all her ſtores, then beauty; that beauty which is the ſalt and light of all things; the Theatre of the infinite power, the object of all our deſires; the Epitome of all perfection; the chiefe ray of the uncreated Sunne; and the Image of the onely God of the whole World.</p>
               <p>Is not Beauty (according to the Platoniſts) the onely thing which the ſoule ownes to be divine in this lower World? So that whoſoever ſhall veile her, may it not be juſtly ſaid of him, that he envies the ſoule its felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and God the honour of the favours hee has done us? Is hee not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell to Nature, who hath decreed us beauty for our chiefe object? and is he not an Enemy to Reaſon, which hath ſo fix'd it ſelfe upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that delight, which pleaſeth the heart, informes the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and elevates the ſoule?</p>
               <p>Whence ſhould we finde Arguments to condemn the impiety of <hi>Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> if this beauty ſhould no more appeare, which carries with her ſo great a ſplendor, that 'tis impoſſible her originall can be deriv'd from any thing, but ſuch a Sunne, whoſe light is eternall? <hi>In fine,</hi> what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all the ſtars of Heaven, and all the faire flowers of the Earth, if all their beauties muſt be hid? and what kinde of Oration muſt mine bee, if nothing of Beauty dare appeare in it?</p>
               <p>But if any of this Auditory deſire to know exactly, what this beauty is? let him heare the witty <hi>Lucians</hi> opinion thereupon: Beauty (ſaith he) is the intrinſick value of all things, which are onely eſteem'd precious ſo far forth as they are adorn'd with beauty; and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> addes, that Vertue her ſelfe is therefore more valuable, then all other things, becauſe more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>'Twas a pretty Queſtion in <hi>Plutarke,</hi> why the Ancients gave order, that the Temple of the Goddeſs <hi>Horta</hi> ſhould alwayes ſtand open? <hi>Labeon</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that 'twas for no other Reaſon, but that this Goddeſs had her very name from the word, to exhort and encourage men to handſome actions: But what is ſo likely to doe that worke, as beauty, being her ſelfe, not only the Theatre, but object of vertuous actions? Shall then the Temples of this Divinity be ſhut up, which not onely exhorts to noble actions, but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them before our eyes? Shall her Images be cover'd with Vailes? I am not able to endure it.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that Beauty doth ſo powerfully captivate the heart, that ſome have thought her an Inchantreſs: But <hi>Olympias,</hi> the Wife of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115194:56"/>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> hath made her Apology: For her Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtrangely in love with a <hi>Theſſaliau</hi> Lady, that all the World ſwore he was bewitch'd; this Queen never left, till ſhe had procur'd the ſight of her; and ſeeing her ſo admirable beautifull, ſhe cri'd out, let no man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her any longer of Witchcraft, ſince ſhe hath ſo many charmes in her eyes.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more? Beauty was cal'd by <hi>Bias</hi> a good thing, which belongs not to the perſon, that hath it, but to him that beholds it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none injoy it, but thoſe that ſee it. So that if this be true by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this admirable Scene, we deprive our ſelves of a glorious ſpectacle of a moſt pleaſing object, of a benefit which of right belongs to us.</p>
               <p>To conclude, (Gentlemen) Beauty hath ſo many advantages over all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, that Hell it ſelfe doth reverence, and adore it; but what did I ſay reverence, and adore? thoſe are effects, which may ſpring from feare in a poore ſpirit; but Hell it ſelfe doth cheriſh, and deſire beauty: The Divels themſelves have often been in love with beauty; whereof the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Stories will furniſh us with plenty of Examples.</p>
               <p>Envy, the moſt miſchievous Monſter in Hell, from which nothing is free under the Sun, humbles her ſelfe before Beauty, which ſhee feares and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: So that <hi>Melancomes</hi> had reaſon for what hee ſaid, that all things are envi'd but Beauty, which is ador'd. And 'tis an infallible marke, that 'tis a divine quality, to which Nature acknowledging her ſelfe inferiour, hath not the boldneſs to envy it.</p>
               <p>Shall we then be more rigorous then Hell? and would we willingly eclipſe that light, which the faire Ladies extract from the Starres; in the brightneſs of her eyes, the whiteneſs of her boſome, the beames of their haire, and the warmth they bring to Lovers? Let beauty live, let her live uncover'd, ſince not juſt to be too ſparing of the favours of Heaven: let Beauty be viſible to the eyes of ſuch as delight in't; but if any be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, let it be for ever conceal'd from him; for 'tis not juſt he ſhould injoy the light of the Stars, who deſires to ſee the sky alwayes clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; let him then rejoice in the unpleaſant rarity of deform'd objects, that deſires to be depriv'd of the pleaſing ſight of beauty.</p>
               <p>For my part, I have little reaſon to condemne it to a Maſque, who ſhould thereby pluck a Thunder-bolt upon my head, that would deſtroy me in an inſtant, in obedience to thoſe that had power to command me: I could doe no leſs then diſcourſe the matter they had appointed me; but 'tis none of my part to decide the queſtion.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:115194:56"/>
               <p>They that wiſh I ſhould give ſentence againſt beauty, are ignorant of my apprehenſions; and he that would have me pronounce againſt deformity, knoweth as little of my Intereſt; how much of my ſelfe muſt I (upon that account) keep for ever from the view of the World, and particularly this Diſcourſe, which hath nothing beautifull in it, but the matter? But if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs (moſt illuſtrious Auditors) you deſire to receive the ſentence of an Oracle in the point, to come to <hi>Delphos,</hi> 'twill not be neceſſary to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> nor to implore mercy of that god, that commands in <hi>Aetolia;</hi> for that ſevere <hi>Apollo,</hi> who did not heretofore afford his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but with much adoe, to the devouteſt of men, is now become prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of them, and by an extraordinary miracle makes his beames ſhine in the Academy of the night.</p>
               <p>Behold! view theſe faire Ladies, and judge whether wee need ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any other Sun-ſhine; and whether our night can ever expect more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtars: you will gueſs by conſidering them, if it be juſt to conceale beauty: whether love can poſſibly permit it, ſince 'twill prove deſtructive to his Kingdome; whether Nature will indure it, ſince it injures her workmanſhip; whether 'twill not provoke God to rank his Image a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch things, as are either hurtfull, or unprofitable; for indeed Beauty masqu'd is but as a Sunne eclips'd, or a treaſure bury'd under ground.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe are ſo many uncertaine words? I have done, and have no more left, but to turn my ſelfe to you, faire Ladies, whom I would call the Graces, if 'twere not an injury to your Beauty to allow a <hi>Venus</hi> above you.</p>
               <p>I have no more to ſay (faire Ladies) but to beg your pardon for our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie, that was ſo blinde to make a queſtion in your bright preſence, whether it might be fit to hide beauty; for when ſhe propos'd this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion amidſt the darkneſs of her night, ſhe had never ſeen the ſplendor of ſo many Suns; nor hath ſhe compar'd beauty, and deformity to injure your faire eyes, but, as a mark of her affection, weighed the one, and the other, to the end, that having exalted that Beauty, wee might lift up our eyes to admire it, and bend our knees to give it reverence.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALexander,</hi> the time is now come, that thou muſt perceive, that either <hi>Alexander</hi> needs no Statue to eternize him in the memories of men, ſince he is ſo deeply graven in their hearts, or that <hi>Steſicrates</hi> alone is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to leave to poſterity the Image of that generous Prince, which can no way reſemble him, unleſs it be fancied of greater things, then the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is able to conceive.</p>
               <p>What? can it be poſſible, that, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom I have heard bewaile, that he was too ſtreightly confin'd within the vaſt compaſs of the Univerſe, ſhould eſteem a little cloth, or a few plates of Braſs a Theatre worthy his Majeſty? And how? can I leave <hi>Alexander</hi> in ſo pitifull a condition? he whoſe onely ſmiles or frowns create the felicity, or terrour of a hundred Kingdomes?</p>
               <p>But what did I ſay? pardon me Great Prince, if I ſpake (before I was aware) of a hundred diſtinct Kingdomes, ſince we now ſee no body reign in the World, but <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> To paint <hi>Alexander</hi> to make his memory live the longer, were a raſh errour: If <hi>Alexander</hi> be borne mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and periſhable, as other men (which I will not undertake to prove) that were to increaſe not his glory, and eternity, but his ſhame, and frailty: He makes thee laſt but for a ſhort time, that wiſhes no more, and ſuch a thing as thy <hi>Apelles</hi> fram'd thee.</p>
               <p>That very thing wherein he hath eſtabliſh'd to future ages the greateſt glory of ours is no ſtronger, then a poore cloth; and what can leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our <hi>Alexander,</hi> then one compos'd of ſo much weakneſs? If hee have fram'd thee of ſo feeble materials to take away the violence of that Thunder-bolt hee hath plac'd in thy hand, I excuſe the kindneſſe hee ſhewes to the world; but if he did it out of a beliefe to anſwer the qualities of the originall, hee is a Liar, a Traytor, a Blaſpheamer, even with his Penſill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the delight of Mankinde, ſhall he put in a capacity to laſt but one age? <hi>Alexander</hi> borne for the good of the World, ought he to be truſted with a Thunder-bolt, but one hundred of years? What? ſhall thoſe that carry thunder be not onely ſubject to the injuries of time, but worms? Doe we multiply <hi>Alexanders</hi> to the end more then one may be deſtroy'd?
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115194:58"/>and who can ſecure us, that the leaſt winde ſhall not carry away our <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as well as his Engle? but how comes it to paſs, that <hi>Lyſippus</hi> hath not been aſham'd to make thee of braſs? thee, who deſerveſt Statues more precious then that of <hi>Artaxcrxes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Braſs is too hard and rude to repreſent an <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo clement; who is never braſs, but when hee fights againſt an Enemy. When thy hand (that hath been ever liberall) ſhall be implor'd to relieve all other mens ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, wilt thou not complaine, though inſenſible, that thy hands are of braſſe? Alas! he that makes not thy hands alwayes doing good, knowes thee not.</p>
               <p>By imitating the features and proportions of the body, we may well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a <hi>Darius,</hi> but not an <hi>Alexander: Alexander</hi> was never buried in the ſuperficies of his Motherswomb; he hath a ſoule which reaches farther then himſelfe; and he muſt have ſomething in him larger, then the greateſt of things, who will picture that <hi>Alexander</hi> for whom the world was too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
               <p>'Tis I. Great Prince, who will frame an <hi>Alexander</hi> which ſhall borrow ſome of the Vertues of the Originall: Heare, conſider, and by the nature of my deſigne judge, what an eſteem I have of thy worth. The large extent of the high and lofty Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> appears in the confines of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whoſe top mounts up even to the very ſtars, and the foot reaches very far into the Sea.</p>
               <p>This is the onely matter I finde worthy to receive from Art the forme of that <hi>Alexander,</hi> who even in Effigies is fit to command the whole Earth: Yes <hi>Alexander,</hi> thy courage hath made thee head of all the Earth, and I am reſolv'd to eſtabliſh thee ſo. This is that <hi>Athos,</hi> whoſe foot was divided from the Continent by <hi>Xerxes</hi> his raſhneſs, who to leave a monument of his power would make it poſſible to ſaile over Mountaines, and to march on foot in the midſt of the Sea.</p>
               <p>What higher thoughts did ever enter into the heart of man? and yet I will bring it to paſs, that the World ſhall ſee the higheſt Fancy of this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Monark, ſhall for ever lie proſtrate at the feet of my <hi>Alexander.</hi> This Image ſhall have a City in the right hand; for even in a Statue the hand of <hi>Alexander</hi> ought not to be without command.</p>
               <p>From the left a River ſhall powre down; for, what can better reſemble <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> liberality, then a River? My intention is, that even in Statue <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> hand ſhould be a Fountaine of goodneſſe.

Is't any new glory to this hand to give away Cities, even for Almes?</p>
               <p>Pictures ought, if it be poſſible, to have not onely the are of thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> they repreſent; but ſomething to denote their principall inclinations, to the end they leave as well their glory as their Countenance to poſterity. Now 'tis impoſſible better to repreſent <hi>Alexander,</hi> or more lively to expreſs his liberall inclination, then by placing a City in his hand, as if he were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it away.</p>
               <p>'Tis in this manner we ought to make Copies of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and not with a Penſill, which draws nothing but the ſhadow of the Body it pretends to imitate, and that but imperfectly.

               <p>The World cannot containe an <hi>Alexander</hi> greater then mine: He that deſires a greater muſt finde a World, that hath more ſpace betwixt Earth and Heaven: He that would fancy him more liberall, muſt finde out a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality more profuſe, then ſuch a one as overflowes, more profitable; then that which nourishes mankinde, more conſtant and durable, then that which belongs to my <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe ſpring ſhall never dry up.</p>
               <p>To make <hi>Alexander</hi> an ordinary thing, though 'twere but onely in an Image, is a crime in that underſtanding, that can ſtoop to ſuch a thought: Wee muſt either finde out ſome place where 'tis impoſſible to erect any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statue, but thine, or finde out ſome matter capable of no other forme: otherwiſe how ſhould we diſtinguiſh thy worth from ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious rich perſon, that had a minde to be equall with, and perhaps greater, then <hi>Alexander?</hi>

               <p>That <hi>Hercules,</hi> which liv'd before thee, knowing that without a rough draught 'twas impoſſible to deſigne an <hi>Alexander,</hi> fixt the bounds which he preſcrib'd to his courage, in the middle of the vaſt extent of the Ocean, to put thee in minde that <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> ought not to erect Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies to their memories in ſuch a place, where the meaneſt Citizen may lay the foundation of his.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou ſuffer the Image of ſo great a King, promiſcuouſly to be made an ornament to every Houſe? Divine <hi>Alexander,</hi> canſt thou (though but in Effigies) indure to have a Maſter? Pardon what I have ſaid; though I am ſo much concern'd in the honour of thy name, I could yet approve of the outrage done to thee, if for the generall good of the Univerſe, they could finde out a man worthy, that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould ſerve for an ornament to his Pallace.</p>
               <p>But who ſhall that man be? If I were to adorne a houſe with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Picture, <hi>Jupiter</hi> forbid! it ſhould honour any other, but his owne. I will frame an <hi>Alexander</hi> which ſhall be an Ornament to the World, a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to Hell, and profitable to all men; I will make an <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſhall have the center of the Earth for his foundation, the Sea for his Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, the Earth for his Theatre, and Heaven for his Pavillion: <hi>Steſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhall be ſubject to no miſadventure but the fall of Heaven, which is ſo neare him.</p>
               <p>If nevertheleſs it be poſſible for him to periſh under thoſe Ruines, who hath ſhoulders ſtrong enough to prop up Heaven, which is the onely part of Nature, which hath not yet been partaker of the good thou haſt done to the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude <hi>Alexander,</hi> I did intend my boldneſſe ſhould imagine things for thy honour, which even timerity her ſelfe durſt not have thought on. The Gyants, to lift themſelves up to Heaven, Fanci'd not a higher Ladder, then I have made for <hi>Alexander;</hi> and yet I feare not Thunder bolts, unleſs Heaven ſhall prove envious of thy Vertues.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt, moſt generous Prince, what kinde of Statue I am preparing for thee; God onely can make a greater: I know not whether 'twill pleaſe thee, but I ſhould be very unfortunate, if <hi>Alexander</hi> (the King of all that are magnanimous, as well as of the <hi>Macedonians</hi>) ſhould undervalue a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which <hi>Steſicrates</hi> to the wonder of the World intends to ſet up to the eternity of his Maſter. The Heavens, the Sea, and the Earth have all ſworn their aſſiſtance to the compleating of ſo marvellous a worke.</p>
               <p>The Sea, as his Tributary will be ever at his feet; the Earth will embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his garments with Trees, Hearbs, and Flowers; and the Heaven will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115194:59"/>crowne the fore-head of <hi>Steſicrates</hi> his <hi>Alexander</hi> with Starres eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>What more legitimate Prince can the Earth obey, then him that ſhall be crown'd by Heaven? In briefe, nothing ought to be above my <hi>Alexander,</hi> but that which can make an <hi>Alexander</hi> greater then mine. That raſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhould dare to attempt to overtop my <hi>Alexander,</hi> cannot poſſibly riſe higher without knocking his head againſt the Region of Thunder-bolts, which would ſoon puniſh his ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hercules,</hi> had no <hi>Steſicrates,</hi> had he had one, he would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelfe with two poore Pillars, which were (to ſay truth) too low a thought for ſo high a Spirit.</p>
               <p>I will let all the World ſee, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> are two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Monarches, and that the bounds of their Empires are very neare one another.</p>
               <p>In effect, if it come not neare Heaven, wat Kingdome is left in the World, to which <hi>Alexanders</hi> extreame courage may further aſpire?</p>

               <p>BEhold at thy feet, O great King, <hi>Apolles,</hi> whom they accuſe upon pretence, that he hath offended <hi>Alexander;</hi> canſt thou believe it? thou who knoweſt that I have alwayes had my ſoule, mine eye, and my hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd neare an <hi>Alexander,</hi> who holds the Thunder in his hand; thou, I ſay, muſt not expect that I will now imploy my hands to petition thee, to be favourable in my cauſe; for thoſe hands which know how to make an <hi>Alexander,</hi> cannot put themſelves into the poſture of petitioning, neither ought I to doe it, for if I have erred, that I have it either by intention, or action; my action hath deified thee, and for my intention I need not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that to a <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he knows the heart; in a word, the ſame I have made thee, the ſame I implore thee.</p>
               <p>O how unfortunate ſhould <hi>Apelles</hi> be, if to be clear'd he were forc'd to offer his vowes in any other place but at thy feet? indeed whither ſhould he go elſe? ſhould hee goe to the feet of that <hi>Jupiter,</hi> from whoſe hand hee hath taken the Thunder, to give it to his <hi>Alexander?</hi> it is not very likely for him to finde protection there?</p>
               <p>My Accuſer is <hi>Steſicrates,</hi> that raſh <hi>Steſicrates,</hi> who envying thy valour, and not knowing how to oblige all the Divinity of Heaven to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> would oblige <hi>Alexander</hi> to remove Mountaines that he might be taken for a Gyant, and have the ſame puniſhment. I will defend my ſelfe, not that I think this accuſation can leſſen me in the opinion of that <hi>Alexander</hi> whom I have made a <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but that they may ſee that none can be near <hi>Alexander</hi> without being enobled with frankneſs of ſpirit, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly debaſed to return due reproach to an inſolent depraver: I have made a Picture of <hi>Alexander</hi> in matter facile, and gentle, to make it reſemble <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> even in facility, and gentleneſs to comply with the love of his ſubjects, who each of them burne, with ardent deſire, to have him their <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to offer their oblations of vows to him; <hi>Alexander</hi> is not only the head, but the heart of all his Subjects.</p>
               <p>If I had framed an ALEXANDER of a ſtupendious fierceneſs, I ſhould have defaced that ſweetneſs, which of an ALEXANDER hath made him eſteemed a God, through all his Dominions: I have made him common, but not vulgar, and if by chance the meanneſs of the matter render him leſs valuable, he hath his weapon of terrour in his hand, the Thunder-bolt will ever procure him reverence; in very being ALEXANDER hee is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable; and being depainted in cloth, he is the more communicable, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall reigne in every houſe, as he doth in every Kingdome, it will be my glory to have multiplied ſo many ALEXANDERS in the world; I might have provided a figure of gold, leſs precious, for all that, then this my object, if I had deſigned to have my ALEXANDER eſteemed for the matter; but in this, ALEXANDER is the ornament of ALEXANDER.</p>
               <p>Let him covet glory from without, who hath none eſſentiall within him: but the Beauty and Majeſty of ALEXANDER hath luſtre enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; I will have all the world bow their knees before this poore piece of cloth, that meane and contemptible thing, which thou ſtriveſt to trample on, O <hi>Steſicrates,</hi> ſhall reigne over all the Mountaines thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneſt!</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> thinking it not fit to diſtinguish the poore from the rich, at leaſt in the ſervice of the gods, ordained by a decree that they ſhould offer no ſacrifice but of things of low price; even ſo, have I facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the meanes for all perſons to be owners of an ALEXANDER, to whom they may pay their dayly reverence; the gods accept the will, and not the Expence; let the windes carry my ALEXANDER whither they can, they ſhall never carry him beyond his Empire; whereſoever he ſhall come, he ſhall finde Subjects and Altars.</p>
               <p>I have made him of Linnen, to make known to the World, the merit of a man who knowes how to make himſelfe adored even in a Picture drawne
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115194:61"/>upon a piece of Canvas: but the envy of this inſolent man, ſtopt not there, he would have me guilty of treaſon becauſe I have placed a Thunder-bolt in the hand of that ALEXANDER, which he would have made of Earth: I have placed a Thunder bolt in his hand, that the world might know that ALEXANDER is my <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that my <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhoots no Thunderbolts, and thereby may learne that ALEXANDER deſerves Incenſe.</p>
               <p>If I had intended to make him as terrible as amiable, I would have plac'd his ſword in his hand, which is a Thunder bolt which never falls in vaine; what? doſt thou wiſh his Thunderbolt had beene throwne? and doſt not perceive, impertinent fool, that if ever it go out of his hand, it will hurt no other ALEXANDER but thine? it will rend Mountains: it was an effect of my gratitude, not my invention, O great Prince, to place a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt in thy hand; for who hath given me <hi>Campaſbe,</hi> the faire <hi>Venus</hi> that reignes in my heart, but ALEXANDER? why ſhould not he, that hath receiv'd a <hi>Venus</hi> from him, furniſh his <hi>Jupiter</hi> with Thunderbolts? and why? can any but <hi>Jupiter</hi> give a <hi>Venus?</hi> but I wonder not at this mans extravagant undertaking, his wit is perverted, hee is an enemy to Nature, and to ſhame her would in ſpite of her teeth, transforme Men into Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and Mountaines into Men.</p>
               <p>O ALEXANDER! he doth not complaine, that I have made thee a Thunderer, but that I have made thee a <hi>Jupiter;</hi> if it were for the worlds ſafety that made him complaine, to ſee the number of the Thunderers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, he would not frame an ALEXANDER that ſhould with his owne hands carry Cities to ruine: this monſtrous Gyant deſerves a more ſevere puniſhment then thoſe of <hi>Phlegra;</hi> for if they raſhly endeavour'd to climb up to Heaven, they were content to leave the Cities at leaſt quiet upon Earth; but I hope there will be no need of Thunder-bolts to ruine this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus,</hi> ſince he carries a River in his hand, ſufficient to overwhelme his pride, and to drowne himſelfe, as a juſt puniſhment of his crime that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to overturn-Mountaines, and to precipitate Rivers; behold what a kinde of ALEXANDER this <hi>Steſicrates</hi> fancies, who is a greater Enemy, and more injurious to the fame of ALEXANDER then to that of <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi>

               <p>What! (my Lords) Mariage, which we may cal the only love Lawful, the bond which unites the Univerſe, and the laſt felicity of unreaſonable man, ſhall that be reckoned amongſt the greateſt misfortunes of humane tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility? I pretend not (my Lords) to prove to you that a Law-ſuit is a greater hinderance to ſtudy, then a Wife, not ſeeing how I can doe it, without ſacriledge; for if I ſay, that a Wife is a leſſe obſtacle to ſtudy then a Proceſs in Law, I ſhould yield that a Wife is a hinderance to ſtudy, which I will never doe, I muſt not be ſo unjuſt or ungratefull to admit of a blame in that eſſence, from whence I have mine, and by whom I expect the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my dayes.</p>
               <p>What obſtacle can ſhee bee to ſtudy, who brings to our houſes wealth, beauty, modeſty, and Vertue, who comforts us in all the miſadventures of our life, who partakes our happineſs, and who becomming an inſeperable companion of our fortunes, diminiſheth our diſpleaſures, and increaſeth our ſatisfaction, by the ſhare ſhe hath in it? no, it is impoſſible that ſhe ſhould be a hinderance to ſtudy.</p>

               <p>A Husband, in comming out of his Cloſet, meets with a Perſon, whoſe complacency cheers him after his ſolitude, whoſe converſation gives new lights to his underſtanding, and who, by the ſweetneſs of her Eyes, makes him forget the paines, which the tediouſneſs of ſtudy gave him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the irkſomneſs, and laſſitude of ſpirit, cauſed by long reading; but if ſhe be a help for ſtudy, and an eaſe to the anxieties which it leaves? ſhe is alſo (as I have ſaid) a ſubject proper for us to ſtudy, and, I thinke, it will not be hard to prove to you, if a Wife be good and vertuous, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in our ſoules an emulation, which inclining us to imitate her, is more profitable to us, and draws us nearer to the way of Vertue, then Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>If on the contrary ſhe hath wicked inclinations, inſtead of being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlacle to ſtudy, ſhe conſtrains us to ſtudy, with care, the way to change and mend her, or to indure her evill cuſtomes with patience; no, no! a Wife is not a hinderance to temperate ſtudy, but ſhe is a hinderance to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch of ſtudy, that is to ſay, to the exceſſive labour, ſince ſhe rules and moderates it.</p>

               <p>A vertuous Wife invites thee to Vertue, and a wicked one makes thee exerciſe it, ſaid that Maſter of knowledge, who ſuffered, with a marvellous tranquility, all the outrages his Wife did him; if I were not afraid to anger thoſe of a contrary opinion to mine, I ſhould ſay, that a Wife is not onely, not an obſtacle to ſtudy, but ſhe is more advantagious then ſtudy it ſelf, if we will conſider the utility of domeſtick affaires; how much labour and time might we expend in ſtudy, before we ſhould gaine ſo much as our Mariage ordinarily affords us?</p>
               <p>We are borne in an age wherein we may ſay, the Muſes field is the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneſt ground we could undertake to manure; if we value profit by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the minde, what ſublunary bleſſing can raiſe us to more felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the affection of a lovely perſon, who in giving us children, gives us the pleaſure of being fear'd, obey'd, and lov'd? if wee will conſider the conſolation in point of Vertue, we ſhall find it ſublime; by the ſweetneſs of her eyes, we may obſerve a Ray of the Divinity, and lift up our thoughts by beholding the marvels in his creature, to the contemplation, and admiration of the Creator; what Bookes, what Philoſophy can teach us ſo perfectly temperance, moderation, piety, devotion, and continence, as the example of a vertuous Wife?</p>
               <p>But if any, in reproving me, ſay that all Women are not faire, and that all Women are not good, I ſhould anſwer him, that there is no Woman ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115194:63"/>ugly, but cuſtome and converſation rendreth faire; nor none ſo wicked, but his Vertue may make good.</p>
               <p>If I would maintaine my tenent by a multitude of Reaſons, the juſtice of my cauſe would furniſh mee with enough; but ſhunning tediouſneſs, what I have ſaid is ſufficient to clear to you, that this Queſtion is a Problem, without Problem, not doubting but you perfectly know, manger the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſcourſe of my Adverſary, that it is impoſſible for a Wife to be a hinderance to ſtudy, but that I may intirely deſtroy a problem, which ſo uncivilly endeavours to diſparage a Sex, for whoſe ſakes I declare my ſelfe partiall, and of whom I am an Adorer, if not an Idolater.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary to adde ſomething, and to maintain alſo, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in Law is no hinderance to ſtudy; for on the contrary, it may advance it: but if any oppoſe my opinion, I will give him for example the diſpute now agitated between us, for the judging whereof, this noble Aſſembly are met.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved in the ſoules of every one in particular, a redoubling of light, and knowledge, which makes me confident, that it is impoſſible, but that a Law-ſuit it ſelfe helps ſtudy.</p>
               <p>Alas! what do I do? little judicious that I am! whilſt I enter to diſcourſe of troubles in Law, I hinder you from going home to give thankes to thoſe amiable Creatures your Wives, whom I have proved to be ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the ſtudy of knowledge.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All Ages have made a Diſpute, whether the Body were the Priſon of the Soule? and</hi> Manzinie <hi>was forc'd to revive this Philoſophicall queſtion, at</hi> Gennes <hi>in the Academy of Sleepers. This ſerves for the Argument of the following diſcourſe.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE greater the Queſtion is, (moſt illuſtrious Auditors) the leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable is it to my abilities: It is to be inquir'd, whether the ſoule be Pris'ner in the body, but which is fit to determine it, the ſoule or the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</p>
               <p>The body cannot diſcourſe it, without being inform'd by the ſoule, and then it followes, that the body is govern'd by the ſoule; but, if the ſoule be to diſcourſe the matter, 'tis neceſſary that the body afford it not only the liberty, but the means, in repreſenting the ſpecies of thoſe objects, which it conceives not onely to helpe the underſtanding, but to direct her in point of election; and from thence it may ſeem that the ſoule is rul'd by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115194:64"/>
               <p>For my part, whatſoever others may ſay, who have more knowledge, I eſteem it a very hard queſtion to reſolve: And as I finde my ſelfe unable to determine it, ſo I think 'twill be ſuperfluous to diſcourſe of it, ſince I ſhall be able to do nothing but multiply difficulties, and contradictions. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to the end my obedience may ſupply the place of merit, and my will amend the defects of my judgement, I am reſolv'd to acquaint you with an adventure which hath happen'd to me; which though it may ſeem a ſtory too farr diſtant from the ſtile of an Oration, it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the buſineſs propos'd by the Academy.</p>
               <p>Doe me the favour to heare; for ſince I ſpeak only to obey, I may boldly ſay, I deſerve to be heard: I was laſt night in my ſtudy drawing ſome few lines to demonſtrate (according to your orders) that the Body is the Priſon of the Soule; when a friend of mine came in, and ask'd me what I was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whether I had nothing to read? I told him I was tranſcribing ſomething which I had compos'd to ſpeak to the Academy, and that I would be glad to ſhew it him, and to be govern'd by his judgement: He expreſs'd a great deſire to heare it, ſo that (as if I had been before this Aſſembly) I began in this manner.</p>
               <p>That the Body (moſt excellent Auditors) is the Priſon of the Soule, the ancient Philoſophers have born Witneſſe; the Divine Prophers have prov'd it, and our owne ſoules make it evident every day; which, being oppreſs'd with the burthen of the mortality of the body, (which is worſe) ſo fettred in this Earthly abode, that they have wholly loſt the uſe of their liberty, which would ſoone conduct them (could they act freely) to that place to which they aſpire, as to their Centre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bring my ſoule out of Priſon,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> wearied, and diſguſted with the unfortunate, painfull, and miſerable condition of our life, into which no man enters, but weeping, nor leaves it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he is reduc'd to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> wrote, that his Body was the burthen of his minde, which was ready to ſinke under the weight, and was kept in continuall chaines. And <hi>Proclus</hi> under the name of confinement ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to inlarge (not mend) this Priſon; for he alwayes declar'd, that God had confin'd the ſoule to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to a peſtilentiall and miſerable place.</p>
               <p>This body is a Priſon in which the ſoule is oblig'd to anſwer before the ſupreame Judge, with what gratitude ſhee hath reſented her creation; and from thence muſt ſhe expect the ſentence, which declaring her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, muſt diſ-ingage her from thoſe bonds, which hinder her from mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:115194:65"/>
               <p>It ſeem'd ſtrange to ſome of the Ancients, who were ignorant of this truth, that God ſhould make the Planets and the Stars of Fire, (for ſo they believ'd) the Winds of Aire, Fiſhes and Birds of Water, and Man of Earth, an Element inferiour to all the reſt, and that Man was thereby oblig'd (at leaſt in the worthineſs of his matter) to give place to the leaſt Bird that flies, and the meaneſt Fiſh that ſwims.</p>
               <p>But they conſider'd not, that 'twas not probable God would have rather made choice of the Earth, then any other Element to frame a Body to the Soule, if he had deſign'd to build her a Pallace.</p>
               <p>He made the body of Earth, becauſe he meant it for a Priſon: when hee reſolv'd afterwards to build them a Royal Pallace, he made uſe of the light, and not of the Earth, and allow'd them the Sun for a cloth of eſtate, and a Throne imbroyder'd with Stars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> affirmes in his <hi>Timens,</hi> that after God had created Soules, hee lodg'd them in the Stars, as in their proper Sphere; as in a place propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to their naturall qualities; and that there was their abode before man was created; but that afterwards (by a ſtrange madneſs) they grew ſo ingratefully in love with Earthly things, and ſo weary of Heavenly, that the Divinity, being infinitely diſpleas'd at their errour, and ingratitude, threw them headlong, from Heaven, and confin'd them to the Body, which is the Priſon where they are tortur'd, and doe penance for their crime: But if any man will reject other mens Authorities, and deſire a clearer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to aſſure him, that the ſoule is indeed a Pris'ner to the Body, the Argument may be fram'd in this manner.</p>
               <p>In relation to its place, the ſoule hath no liberty, for although it be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, like an Angel, nevertheleſs it cannot, like an Angel, remove it ſelfe from place to place, ſo much is it tied to the body. It hath no liberty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its objects, becauſe being a Pris'ner ſhe abſolutely depends upon the will of her Jaylor.</p>
               <p>She can think nothing without thoſe Idea's the Body repreſents, nor doth any thing enter into the underſtanding, which paſſeth not through the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Nor hath this poor P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is'ner any more light to her minde, nor liberty to her will, but what it pleaſeth her Keeper to grant.</p>
               <p>If this ſevere Guardian ſleep, it is then, that, contrary to the Nature of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pris'ners, ſhe is ſo cloſely lock'd up, and ſo totally depriv'd of liberty, that although it bee moſt certaine, that the Soule wakes, whilſt the Body ſleeps, yet is it as undoubted an Axiom (which cannot be queſtion'd in our Church without a crime) that what operation ſoever the Soule may have during ſleep, it can neither merit nor offend.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115194:65"/>
               <p>Judge then, whether the ſoule be free, when it hath not ſo much as the liberty to ſin: The Soul hath no liberty to operate, unles the Body give it; nor hath it leave to refuſe thoſe imployments, which that commands. In what then can the Soul be free in the Body? And truly (to paſſe from intellectuals to manners) if the Soule were not faſten'd to the Body, how is it probable it could be pleas'd in ſo unlucky a Manſion, which all Ages have confeſs'd to bee onely a place of complaint, and miſery?</p>
               <p>O miſerable man! one cannot ſo much as name thee, without treading thee under foot; thy Body being compos'd of Earth, thou art throwne to the ground, as ſoone as thou art nam'd; thou art impriſon'd in a Body made of Earth, conceiv'd in ſin, borne in paine, and expos'd to all the tyranny of fortune, to whom all ſeaſons are troubleſome, all the Elements dangerous: Thy Soule is plac'd in a body, which derives its diſeaſes from its proper nouriſhment, and perils from its owne wealth, which loves not without griefe, hates not without trouble, and poſſeſſeth nothing without torment: in a body to which the influence of Heaven deſignes diſaſters, the Earth brings forth death, and hell prepares torments.</p>
               <p>Judge then whether a ſoule created to bee partaker of eternall felicity can willingly make that her habitation? But why doe I ſpeake of Heaven and Hell? thoſe are things too great to be nam'd in a diſcourſe of ſo meane a ſubject.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate man is obnoxious (both dead and alive) to ſuch things as ſcarce have a being, which may (almoſt) be call'd nothing. An atome animated, a flea devours his bloud; a Worme of the Earth will gnaw him, if he be a Giant: and after all this cannot be thought, that the Soule (which is but little inferour to the Angels, which may and ought to aſpire to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory) ſhould willingly and without conſtraint, dwell in a body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe conditions? ſure 'tis impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The ancient Philoſophers, who were men of great wiſdome, did very rightly ſay, that a dying man was ſet at liberty, and layd to reſt, when hee was dead.</p>
               <p>But if ſome men ſhould doubt this truth, by ſeeing with what an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoule is tied to the body, and when 'tis forc'd to leave it, with what extraordinary expreſſions of ſorrow it ſighs, to part with a place, which it would never grieve at, had it not been pleaſed with it: let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it ſighs and laments, not for love of the place ſhe is to leave, but feare of that, to which ſhe is going: for, who can aſſure her ſhe is not to dye with the body, ſaid <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> who had not learn'd a better Doctrine from the Schoole of the Goſpel?</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115194:66"/>
               <p>The life the gods have given is a hidden thing, ſaith <hi>Heſiod.</hi> If the Soule then feares not to die, as to its being, it may, as to its well being. No man knows whether he be worthy of love or hate, and therefore the Soule of a juſt perſon will part with leſſe griefe, and more aſſurance, then a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, becauſe the goodneſs of a mans life makes him reaſonably hope for happineſſe at his death.</p>
               <p>Moſt noble Auditors, I was ſcarce advanc'd thus far in my diſcourſe, or to ſpeake truth, I had ſcarcely begun to read him my Reaſons, when my friend (who had before expreſs'd by his wry-mouths and gaping at me, how little ſatisfaction hee receiv'd by my Arguments) interupted me in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; hold your peace, ſaid he: for (by the faire Eyes that I adore) I am no longer able to indure this impertinence.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak with that ſincerity which a Soule ought to have, that loves truly: and how is it poſſible, that ſuch a man as you, who have alwayes delighted in the beauty of Learning, ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to bee throwne downe headlong into ſuch low conceptions? In what condition are you? what? the Body the Priſon of the Soule? he ſpake this in ſuch a manner, with ſuch a kinde of ſcorne in his Eyes, that inſtead of angring me, he made me laugh; and preſently drawing a golden Caſe out of his pocket, hee drew neare the Lights, and ſhew'd mee the Picture of a Lady extreamly beautifull: I confeſſe the ſight ſurpriz'd me, and that my ſoule was fixt upon't with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and that I turn'd not mine eyes off from it, but to have the content to returne.</p>
               <p>I had continued longer in this extaſie, had not my friend catch'd his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture out of my hands: And now (ſaid he) what do you reſolve? can you ſtill continue in your falſe opinion? I, who by this admirable Viſion was not onely diſturb'd in the courſe of my bloud, but of my reaſon; aſſur'd him, that I knew not, what he meant to inferre upon his Propoſition: Hee anſwer'd me on a ſudden; If thou be not ſtarke blinde, Judge whether ſuch Bodies as this repreſents, are fitter to be call'd horrid priſons, or objects of felicity?</p>
               <p>I preſently apprehended the ſubtilty of his amorous Philoſophy, and made him anſwer, that I acknowledg'd my ſelfe vanquiſh'd, and would preſently teare my papers, that they might not remaine as teſtimonies againſt mee of my former errour: But hee would not ſuffer mee to doe it, but ſpake to mee in this manner: That thou mayeſt not believe, that the blindneſſe of love rather then the ſtrength of Reaſon invites mee to oppoſe thy Arguments, doe mee the favour to heare me a little.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:115194:66"/>

                  </gap>, and light, loves the Body; Therefore the Body is the good, and not the Priſon of the Soule. <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath prov'd the <hi>major,</hi> and the Soule proves the <hi>minor</hi> (as thou thy ſelfe haſt confeſt) when being forc'd to part with the Body it complaines and afflicts it ſelfe at this ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now, that the Body is the good of the Soule, and that conſequently it loves the Body out of its owne intereſt, and affection (and not for feare of being buried with it, as <hi>Themistius</hi> ſaid; nor by the violence of a forc'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as <hi>Seneca</hi> did almoſt believe) I thinke I ſhall have no hard taske to prove, having Reaſon and <hi>Thomas Aquimas</hi> on my ſide: What difference (ſayd this Angelicall Doctor, who had a greater priviledge then any other to treat of Angels) what difference can be found betwixt an Angel and the reaſonable ſoule? The difference is, (ſaith he) that although both the one, and the other are ſpirituall ſubſtances, which may exiſt without a Body, the Angel nevertheleſs is perfect without the Body, but the Soule without the Body is imperfect.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this imperfection is, becauſe the Soule (being the very eſſentiall forme of the Body, and ſo eſſentially but a part) when it is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that part which concurs with it in the conſtitution of the whole, muſt needs remaine imperfect.</p>
               <p>From hence is riſen that opinion of ſome Divines, who it is poſſible in ſome meaſure to prove the reſurrection of the Body, even from the naturall ſight of Reaſon: becauſe the Soule, being naturally imperfect without the Body (as the form without the matter) &amp; having a continued deſire of being re-united; it is a thing which appeares not conformable to Nature (which cannot indure perpetuall violence) that the Soule ſhould be for ever imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and be continually agitated with an unceſſant deſire, and longing after accompliſhment of its naturall inclination: And therefore many believe that the happineſs of the Soule in Heaven ſhall not bee in its full perfection, untill the Body be likewiſe glorified.</p>
               <p>So wonderfully are we made, (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) that Reaſon poſſeſſeth the Soule, and the Soule poſſeſſeth the Body: and <hi>Aristotle</hi> gave this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that the Soule might governe the Body, as the Maſter commands the Soule.</p>

               <p>But not to trouble you with ſo much Philoſophy, behold (and then to my great content he opened the Box again) behold this face, that proves it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all the Arguments in the World: I know thou look'ſt upon it with joy, and I very willing to contribute any thing to thy delight: Behold it, take it, and draw your Arguments.</p>
               <p>I reply'd, I was ſatisfied, and wiſh'd him all content, who had ſhew'd me a face, that pleas'd me ſo much. In concluſion, I ſee that Love is a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, a Philoſopher, a Poet, a Divine, and what you will, and he that is not in Love is nothing; ſo that, my deare friend, it is not without Reaſon, that thou admirſt a face, which hath taught thee ſo many ſciences.</p>
               <p>I have reaſon indeed (anſwer'd he) ſo to doe, for ſhould I doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I muſt acknowledge my ſelfe both ungratefull, and ſtupid; for, to conclude (and then he tooke up his Poetick Vaine) who would not adore a Face, whoſe Eyes are Stars, or rather Suns; whoſe haire are threads of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt gold, &amp; her complexion fairer then <hi>Aurora</hi> in her brighteſt luſtre? who would not adore a perſon, whoſe lips were of Corall, her teeth of pure I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and her voice equall to that Goddeſs, which the ancient Poets call'd HARMONY?</p>
               <p>Who would not adore ſuch a face as appears ſo beautifull, that 'twould doe the Sun an honour to be compar'd to it? To this ſparkling Beauty only I can compare the Stars, when I would flatter them: But let neither the Sun nor Stars grow proud of this compariſon; for certainly they muſt both yield, as well in power, as beauty to this incomparable. If the Sun can boaſt of being the Authour of life; this face hath the power of life, and death.</p>
               <p>If the Stars glory of the power of their influence, thoſe Eyes determine our deſtinies at their owne pleaſure; I will not ſay as it pleaſeth their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; for I will not place tyranny in Heaven.

                     <hi>I did never wonder much, that a Man compos'd of ambitious deſires, after the goods of fortune might bring himſelfe to complaine, that a ſingle World was not ſufficient to ſatisfie his deſire of glory: but I have not a little marvel'd that any heart could poſſibly grieve at that power, which all others ſo vehemently deſire.</hi> Seleucus <hi>ſigh'd at his being borne a King, and eſteem'd himſelfe buried under (not adorn'd with) that Diadem, which others account a Character of Divinity. I have often thought to have ſacrific'd to Fame to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline her to ſilence this fact; but finding it impoſſible to ſtop her mouth, I am reſolv'd to oppoſe this Diſcourſe, which cannot be heard without indignation, nor ought to bee paſſed by without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115194:68"/>Thus</hi> Manzinie <hi>deſign'd the Argument of the inſuing Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE deſire of Command hath alwaies beene the ſtrongeſt paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt men; ſo that conſidering often the extreame impetuoſity of this generous affection, which hath ſo often overturn'd the World, I could not chuſe but ſearch into the Cauſe which hath produc'd this painfull long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Mankinde.</p>
               <p>But reading in Geneſis, where the Creator conſidering his owne excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in that of his laſt piece of Workman-ſhip: I obſerv'd, that hee no ſooner ſaw that this work was good (as the Scripture ſaith) but by a Divine impatience, (if it bee lawfull ſo to ſpeak) he inſtantly began to bleſſe him, call'd him to the government of all things upon Earth, &amp; gave him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over all living Creatures; as if God had ſaid that power was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of all bleſſings, and that whoſoever had obtain'd it, might, and ought to eſteem himſelfe happy.</p>
               <p>I proteſt to you (my Noble Auditors) I was ſomething exalted with this conceit, whereof I thought my ſelfe the Author: But I happen'd on a paſſage, which made me know that, in truth, it was a Divine Conception, lively expreſs'd by God himſelfe; ſince that <hi>Eſau</hi> complaining that <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſtolen away the bleſſing from him, (that is to ſay, the government of his Fathers Inheritance) ſeems likewiſe to infer, that the bleſſing is no other thing, but onely the right to command.</p>
               <p>Who will hee then bee, that conſidering thoſe eminent prerogatives of dominion, will not (as I doe) pity thoſe famous unhappy perſons, who have unfortunately, rather then wickedly, loſt their lives in purſuit of their deſire of advancing themſelves to government? I ſhall wonder no more that ſome men have had ſo high thoughts of themſelves, that they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to have Altars, and Incenſe devoted to them, as if they were gods indeed.</p>
               <p>This excellent condition of Ruling is ſo great, and accompanied with a traine of ſo many eminent additions, that 'tis no ſtrange thing, that a man (proud in his owne Nature) ſhould ſtraggle out of the way, and ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be cozen'd by this honour, which certainly hath ſomething of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in it, if the matter in which it reſides, corrupt it not. This man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelfe adorn'd with a ſoule, whoſe noble and divine qualities have brought forth ſo much admiration, that many (with <hi>Plato</hi>) have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves, that 'twas coeternall with God, and others (as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115194:68"/>that 'twas of the ſame ſubſtance with God: This man (I ſay) ſeeing himſelfe in ſo eminent a degree, if he cannot ſay with <hi>Job</hi> (when he went about to conteſt with God) <hi>Now that mine Eyes have ſeene thee, I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes,</hi> may eaſily be brought to ſuch a degree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as was repreſented by <hi>Ovid</hi> in the Fable of the Giants; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if thoſe favours be rightly weighed, by which God hath exalted the excellency of Humane Nature; they will appeare ſo admirable, that not onely the Saracene <hi>Abdala</hi> (who had nothing of the knowledge of God) call'd it the Miracle of Miracles.</p>
               <p>But <hi>David</hi> himſelfe (not able to ſuppreſs his aſtoniſhment of ſuch a multitude of mercies) cry'd out, <hi>What is Man, that thou haſt ſo exalted him? thou haſt made him little leſſe then the Angels, with glory and honour haſt thou crown'd him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then if unto Man, who is by Nature ſo great, and in his owne eſteeme much greater, there be the addition of a Kingdome, whoſe power renders him formidable and omnipotent, there is no cauſe to wonder, if he pretend to Altars, and Incenſe, ſince he may then ſay, that the deſtiny of the People depend upon his will, and the good or ill of all his Subjects; which may pull downe or erect Cities, as he pleaſe, who is above Laws and diſpenſes Fortune at his pleaſure; on whom depend both war, and peace; death, and life; and in concluſion, then whom nothing appears higher, but Heaven it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> that great Prince, who made one Kingdome of the whole World, after having view'd the vaſt extent of his Dominion, that it even border'd with Heaven, ſeeing himſelfe plac'd ſo near Divinity, reſolv'd to believe himſelfe a God.</p>
               <p>And truly power is a thing too great, and too Divine not to be deſir'd; and he muſt be a mad man, that knowes not the value of ſuch a thing, as is ſo vehemently purſued by all Mankinde. When then I found a man, and him a King that not onely deſpis'd Royalty, but complain'd of it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that whoſoever did truly know the weight of a crown, would not ſo much as ſtoop to the ground to take it up, I could not but bee infinitely aſtoniſh'd.</p>
               <p>For how is it poſſible a mans heart ſhould be capable of ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to eſteem Command a Servitude, and a Kingdome a miſery? I have choſen this poore apprehenſion of <hi>Seleucus</hi> for the ſubject of my Diſcourſe, to the end, that, examining the lowneſſe of his Spirit, wee might likewiſe finde out (moſt Noble Auditors) the unhappineſſe of Tyranny, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords nothing but bitterneſſe amidſt the ſweetneſs of a Kingdome.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:115194:69"/>
               <p>This King-like Act of Ruling is nothing elſe but the government of a lawfull King, as the onely object of a vertuous Prince is the publique good; ſo that, I muſt confeſſe, if to labour for the good of the Common-wealth be a thing to make Royalty be thought odious; it is moſt certaine a man may loath it upon that ſcore, ſince 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be free from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and cares; and which do ſo neceſſarily take up a Kings time, that hee can never be idle, but the Common-wealth is the looſer.</p>
               <p>But who perceives not, that to complaine of being oblig'd to watch for the Publick ſafety, to looke after the integrity of his Miniſters; to provide for the neceſſities of the poore, and to prevent the extortions of the Rich, and the deſignes of Neighbour Princes, is to grieve at a continuill neceſſity, impos'd upon him of exerciſing his Prudence, Juſtice, Charity, Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all other the moſt perfect acts of Vertue; or rather 'tis to be ſorry to be obliged to tend to his owne center, which is nothing elſe, but to complaine of being tyed to his owne happineſs?</p>
               <p>Royalty is without doubt accompanied with ſome trouble; but whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wil like <hi>Moſes</hi> have the Tables of the Law in his power, muſt (no more then he did) ſhun the pains of getting up to the top of the Mountain. He that will appeare upon the throne, with the ſword of Juſtice in his right hand, muſt not be unwilling to lift the Billance of Equity in his left: Labour, and a Kingdome are Relatives, but that which we call labour, is a duty, an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not a diſquiet, a calamity: that motion which tends to its owne center is never painfull; the fire mounts to its owne ſphere without any paine, and the water which runs towards the Sea, ſuffers no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>If all things, which are inſeparable from humanity, were painfull, it would be ſo not onely to be a King, but to be a Man; nay, our very being would be a trouble to us, there being nothing in Nature, which is not liable to theſe conditions.</p>
               <p>A Pellican parts willingly with her life to preſerve her young ones, and ſhall we thinke it painfull and irkſome to be oblig'd to thinke, to watch, and take paines for the good of our People? but why doe I call it taking pains? the body is out of temper, when tis a paine to it to performe its naturall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.</p>
               <p>He that findes difficulty in a Kingdome, betrayes the weakneſs of his conſtitution, and that his inclination is not Royall: but whether it proceed from the ignorance, lazineſs, or malice of thoſe poore ſpirits; many there bee, who change the true names of things, who take the Maske for the Face, who eſteem care, ſimple thoughts, and buſineſs, fooliſh operations,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115194:69"/>and after that rate 'tis no ſtrange thing, that to him (who accounts the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Soveraignty a paine, and the thoughts troubles) Royalty it ſelfe ſhould appeare a ſlavery.</p>
               <p>He that calls the leaſt motions of care and buſineſs, labour and trouble, is not to be thought to be of a Nature that's quiet, and peaceable, but feeble and uſeleſs: and how? ſhall wee account thoſe imployments burthen, ſome, which are our duties, as Fathers, and as Chriſtians? No, no, he that complains of buſineſs, and action, is griev'd, that he cannot bee idle, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and lazie.</p>
               <p>Was it not (O illuſtrious Auditors) an unjuſt complaint of that Prince, who not finding forrage ready in a quarter for the Horſe of his Army, much bewayled the unhappineſs of Kings, that were bound to take care even of the very Beaſts: And who cannot eaſily diſcerne, that to be the miſery of men, but the meer condition of Humanity?</p>
               <p>Nature who hath linck'd all things together, as with a chaine, hath well ordered, that one thing ſhould be neceſſary to another, but not inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: To complaine of being obliged to take care of Horſes, is to repine, that we are not able to walk without feet, that we were not created Angels, which can operate with the intellect alone.</p>
               <p>Tis the duty, not the miſery of a Generall to take care of his Baggadge Horſes, if he expects ſervice from them, that they ſhould remove him from Aegypt into Lybia, &amp; give him the Water of <hi>Nilus</hi> to drink upon the moſt inacceſſible heights of <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and the Pirenean Mountaines. The ſailes of a Veſſell are made to conduct it, and not to burthen, or overſet it; and yet thoſe are they, which theſe lazy perſons call burthens or intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight.</p>
               <p>But theſe things which thou complaineſt of, are but the exerciſes of life, and not the troubles of a Kingdome: where wilt thou finde the eaſe which thou deſireſt, if every thing have the power to diſquiet thee? A poore flie did more diſturb <hi>Domitian</hi> in his Chamber, then an Army of an hundred thouſand Men could trouble <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he was in the field ready to aſſault them.</p>
               <p>But what thing will theſe poore ſpirits finde out to wiſh for, that is wholly free from trouble? The Garden requires ſweating with a Mattock: Reſt and Labour are the entertainments of Nature, not the deſtruction. One man ſcorches under the heat of the <hi>African</hi> Sun to catch a few Birds; another freezes upon the Ice of <hi>Scythia</hi> to kill Veniſon: This labour and pains they thinke well imployd for ſo ſmall a matter, and wilt thou thinke much to take a little care for the publicke good, and that in the view of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115194:70"/>whole world? Me thinks thou ſhouldſt be aſham'd of the thought; as I am to ſpeake it.</p>
               <p>If Labour were an ill thing, whereof had man greater cauſe to complain, then of Vertue? whoſe actions for the moſt part conſiſt in the incounter of difficulties, which to overcome the means, is by taking pains, as the end is procur'd by conſtancy, and magnanimity.</p>
               <p>Behold a ſpectacle worthy of the ſight of God himſelfe, <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtling with an Angel. Amongſt all the Vertues which have their faculties, either act ve or paſſive, thoſe actions are alwayes the moſt excellent, which labour after matters of greateſt difficulty: and conſequently they are moſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to a Prince, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of his power. A great ſoul cannot deſire but great things, and cannot but emulate thoſe, that have done great actions; which made <hi>Themistocles</hi> ſay, that the Victories of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciades</hi> would never let him ſleep.</p>
               <p>What a difference was there betwixt two ſoules? <hi>Seleucus</hi> complains of the paine of commanding, and <hi>Alexander</hi> is griev'd, that his Fathers Victories had not left him worke enough. Nothing is ſweeter, then glory, nor is there any ſtraighter way to it, then Vertue, and the way to Vertue is not without paine.</p>
               <p>Aske <hi>Hercules,</hi> whether he was deified for any thing, but his Labours? <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid, that buſineſs was the nouriſhment of generous ſpirits: A noble courage cannot indure, that operative Vertue ſhould conſume in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a Sword is ſpoyl'd with ruſt. In the end, I ſhould conclude labour a gift from Heaven, did I not incline to their opinion, that eſteeme it no paine to a Noble ſoule.</p>
               <p>He is onely in paine, that is inferiour to the worke he undertakes, which a generous perſon cannot be. <hi>Corolianus,</hi> being invited to reſt after a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, anſwered, that the Conqueror was never weary: And <hi>Canus</hi> that plaid upon the Flute, told thoſe that heard him, that if they knew how great a pleaſure hee tooke in his owne Muſicke, they might juſtly pretend to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for hearkening to him: ſo true is it, that Nature facilitates, and ſweetens all things, to which the will inclines.</p>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt, this Scepter weighs heavy; I tell thee thou wanteſt as Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtrength: Poyſon can doe no hurt, when it meets with a temper hot enough to reſiſts its cold, whereof Mithridates was a teſtimony. He that groans under a burthen, ought not to accuſe the weight, but his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: an Oxe is not too heavy for a man that dares compare his ſtrength with <hi>Mile.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:115194:70"/>
               <p>But perhaps, you will ſay, that to Reigne is a word that implies Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a troubleſome and dangerous thing, and I muſt anſwer that no man is afraid, but he that has an ill conſcience; hee that feares confeſſes, hee has cauſe ſo to doe; and that which we call Evils in things, are rather Vices in men.</p>
               <p>That Prince (who, out of love to his pleaſures, neglects the care he ows to his People,) cannot be ignorant of his crime, even whilſt he is in the act, and in that ſenſe may truly ſay, he feels the weight of a crowne. In truth, he that hath cauſe to feare, in his Kingdome, is no King, but a Tyrant; and he that complains of Conſtancy, Fortitude, Juſtice, and Prudence, is griev'd to ſee himſelfe bound to act conſtantly, valiantly, juſtly, and wiſely; what can be more juſt and pleaſing then the performance of good, honourable and vertuous actions? and where can they be acted with more honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, then upon the Royall throne? Is it poſſible for us to believe that thing deteſtable, which is alwayes accompanied with juſtice, and power? which alwayes propoſeth the publique good for its end, and whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall imployment is, to exalt Vertue, and ſuppreſs Vice?</p>
               <p>Tis true, a Kingdome is a matter of great conſequence, and requires the whole Man: But the greatneſs of this Engine ought to provoke his care, that is to move it, not his feare.</p>
               <p>How many times have we ſeen Maſſes of ſione of a vaſt bigneſs lifted up into the aire by a ſmall Vice, which giving motion to a wheele, and that communicating it to other leſſer wheeles have beene able (if I may ſo ſay) to remove mountains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> might have ſaid with much more juſtice, that he was unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a crowne, then that a Kingdome was of no value. The King is the head of the State, and it ought not to be troubleſome to him to act for ſuch a Body, whereof all the Members combine to doe him ſervice.</p>
               <p>The King is the tye by which the Common-wealth is united, and that very breath of life which is ſuck'd in by ſo many perſons: The Throne is the Theatre of glory, and thoſe Vertues, which in a private man were but ſimply Vertues, when they are in a King, they are a light and ſplendour, by whoſe beams other men are warm'd, inlightned, and guided. Who would have known the vertues of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> if they had been buried under a private fortune?</p>
               <p>As a Kingdome is a large field, where Vertue hath roome enough to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her ſelfe: ſo doth the Throne by its Eminence, render all good qualities the more viſible, and makes Kings appeare like mortall gods, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with magnificence, juſtice, and power, attributes ſit for adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115194:71"/>and only proper to Divinity. I obſerve (with great admiration) that God having reſolv'd the Creation of the World from all eternity, and fram'd the <hi>Idea</hi> thereof in that moſt pure intellect, which hath onely it ſelfe for intelligence, and it ſelfe for intelligible: I (obſerve I ſay) in the ſacred Writ, that God having reſolv'd the Creation of man, and deſiring to let all things take notice of his great inclination, to make that Creature wholly like himſelfe, he cries out, <hi>Let us make Man after our owne image:</hi> and as if that expreſſion had been ſhort of that ſo much deſired reſemblance, hee addes, <hi>and after our likeneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs the vehemence and earneſtneſs, wherewith God was pleaſed to publiſh his deſire, aſtoniſh'd mee: ſo that inquiring further, to finde out how thoſe words were put into actions, I diſcovered, that, after that the Divine Majeſty had created this man, and given him a reaſonable ſoule, worthy this noble reſemblance, immediatly thereupon he made him Maſter of all things, ſaying unto him, <hi>Have dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowle of the Ayre, and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, the underſtanding as reaſonable ſhall be the Image of God in operation: But becauſe I thinke that too little for my Creature, I will hove him likewiſe reſemble mee in power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bids him, <hi>have dominion,</hi> &amp;c. that I may truly ſay, <hi>ye are gods, and the ſons of the moſt high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who then ſees not (moſt noble Auditors) that Royalty and Soveraigne power are acknowledg'd by God himſelfe for the laſt, and moſt excellent ſtrokes of his Penſill, by which the all powerfull hand of the Creator did intend to marke Mankinde with a moſt eminent, and indelible Character of Divinity.</p>
               <p>And for this we finde a man, who repines at this excellent condition, which in truth is rather worthy of that deſire, with which the Angels burn inceſſantly in love to God, then of this earthly man, who hath ſo little ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, that he had rather injoy his ſolitude in a Wood, like wild Beaſts, then the ſplendid throne of a King to operate like a God: For indeed to be a King, what is it elſe, but to be the object of all men, the rule of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the Looking-glaſs for all eyes, and the example for all inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
               <p>He is the ſoule of the Republique, the living Law of the People, the light of his Kingdome, and the Image of God upon his Throne. He that accounts this condition unhappy, eſteems it a misfortune to have the honour to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of divinity, and thinketh it a miſery to bee able to make his people proſperous: He's a Monſter, borne onely for himſelfe, and unuſefull to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115194:71"/>all Mankinde, unleſs it be to ſuch, as, conſidering his errours, reſolve not to be like him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> though himſelfe poore, becauſe hee was maſter but of one World; and this Coward repmes at one Kingdome onely, as if <hi>Atlas</hi> had plac'd all his burthen upon his ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>All earthly things are ſo imperfect, that the ſoule which aſpires to infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not being content with any thing that is corruptible, is as eaſily cloy'd with every particular, as it can deſire all.</p>
               <p>Tis very true, there is a vaſt difference betwixt one mans heart, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for to <hi>Alexanders</hi> (which was great in all things) a Crowne ſeem'd not ſo burthenſome, as to <hi>Seleucus;</hi> becauſe the Magnanimity of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> rejoyced in ſo ample a field to exerciſe his Vertue, whereas the other was ſo weake, that the leaſt weight ſuppreſt it. And upon this Reaſon that famous Conquerour was angry at <hi>Senocrates,</hi> becauſe when he offered him fifty talents, he refuſed it, as not needing ſo much.</p>
               <p>This generous Prince cryed out (all amazed) why then <hi>Senocrates</hi> has no need of a friend; to <hi>Senocates</hi> fifty Talents are a ſuperſluity, and to mee all the wealth of <hi>Darius</hi> was too little? But the true reaſon was, not, that this Treaſure was too great for <hi>Senocrates,</hi> or <hi>Seleucus,</hi> but that <hi>Senocrates,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> were of ſuch poore ſpirits, that wanting magnanimity, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, magnificence, and liberality, they thought thoſe riches burthenſome, which they had not the hearts either to ſpend or give away. How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible this Crowne ſhould ſeem a burthen to thee, which furniſheth thee with oportunity to doe good to the people, which gives thee power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed, to puniſh wickedneſs, and uphold Vertue, and to make thy ſelfe reverenced as a divine Power?</p>
               <p>For indeed were it not for death, which as a tribute upon all Mankinde, makes no diſtinction, by what Argument could we prove, that a King were not a God, and the Throne Heaven?</p>
               <p>But if a wicked Prince perceive a ſword hanging by a ſlender thread over his head, ready to fall, and puniſh him for his crimes, let him finde fault with himſelfe, and not his Kingdome, with himſelfe (I ſay) who making Royalty degenerate into Tyranny, expoſeth himſelfe to the dangers that follow it.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeake the truth, I am not ſo much delighted with the occaſion of exclaiming againſt the baſeneſſe of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who could not bee pleas'd with being a King, as I am ſatisfied with the opportunity of ſpeaking of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe very memory fills mee with joy: That <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe liberality emptied all the Treaſures of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and tir'd out the fertility
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115194:72"/>of the <hi>Erythraean</hi> Sea, by the abundance of precious things, which he gave away: of that generous <hi>Alexander,</hi> for whom the whole world was too little: of that brave courage, whoſe greateſt labours were his chiefeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: of that brave, Lion I would call him, but that I remember, Lions are to derive honour from him by the Compariſon, ſince hee ſhew'd himſelfe braver then a Lion by killing one hand to hand.</p>
               <p>But what conſequence can we poſſibly draw from the opinion of <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus?</hi> If we conſider <hi>Alexander,</hi> complaining that hee was not able to bee confin'd within the limits of one World from a parallel of their different conceptions, wee might give judgement and determine, which of them is moſt to be eſteem'd.</p>
               <p>But 'twill bee ſufficient to ſay onely, that <hi>Seleucus</hi> had ſo much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, as to contemne a Crowne, as ſuppoſing himſelfe burthen'd, and buried under it; but that <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo weake, and unſatisfied, that he endeavoured to fancy new Worlds, believing himſelfe too ſtraitly impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd within the compaſs of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>But ſhould they heare <hi>Seleucus,</hi> what would <hi>Caſar, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> ſay, and ſo many others, who have ventur'd to ruine the World, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what he deſpiſeth?

               <p>If that which we call Beauty be not a Deity, it is at leaſt adored as ſuch, as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> ſaid Wealth, Strength, Wiſdome, Greatneſs of Courage, and all other adornments which may render a perſon remarkable, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ambition and Envy of men; but Beauty alone, the Divels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have not onely reverence, but affection for: The Hiſtories and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our Fathers have often told us, the veneration they had for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               <p>Her Eyes were not ſuch cruell Tyrants, that we drew from thence feare, and ſervitude onely, and not love: on the contrary, all their Slaves were their Adorers, and all their Captives became their Captives willingly, and the cauſe of their thraldome was the object of their veneration.</p>

               <p>You my Lords, know what they were; in the meane time they are extinguiſhed, in the midſt of their triumphs, but I feele my heart rebell againſt my judgement, and ſay that it betrayes its affections, it deſires that I not onely lament <hi>Emilia,</hi> but that I make imprecations, againſt the rigour of the ſtars, whoſe mallignant influences have ſo haſtily raviſht from us <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia;</hi> what ſay you my Lords, doe you conſent to this motion of my griefe? will you that I follow it? if you will permit it?
